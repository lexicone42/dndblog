Cribben's fate took a dark turn when the Night Hag's curse affected him differently than the others, transforming him into a toad. He hopped off into Whisperwood Forest and was never seen again.\n\n## Background\n\nCribben joined the party at the very beginning of their adventure in Phandalin, answering Townmaster Riglid's call to investigate the raids and kidnappings plaguing the town's supply lines.\n\n## Abilities\n\nAs a druid, Cribben demonstrated:\n- **Thorn Whip** — Used to incapacitate enemies and give the party tactical advantages\n- **Wild Shape** — Could transform into animals (ironically, his final transformation was involuntary)\n- **Nature Magic** — Connection to the natural world\n\n## Key Moments\n\n### Session 3 - The Ulfandor Mines\nDuring the battle in the skeletal ossuary, Cribben initially transformed into a rat but then used his Thorn Whip to incapacitate enemies and allow the party to gain the upper hand.\n\n### Session 4 - The Night Hag's Curse\nWhen the Night Hag cursed the party in Whisperwood Forest, the curse affected Cribben differently than the others. While the rest of the party suffered wisdom penalties that the Dryad Erinthin later lifted, Cribben was unwillingly transmuted into a toad and hopped off into the forest, never to be seen again.\n\n## Current Status\n\nCribben's fate remains unknown. Whether he still lives somewhere in Whisperwood as a toad, eventually broke free of the curse, or met some other end is a mystery. The Dryad Erinthin lifted the curse on the remaining party members, but Cribben had already disappeared into the forest by that time.\n\n## Legacy\n\nCribben's sudden disappearance serves as a stark reminder of the Night Hag's cruelty and the dangerous, unpredictable nature of Whisperwood Forest. His empty place at the party's campfire is a wound that has never fully healed."

Ley energy arced from Skid to Molrik's lantern.\n\n### Session 9 - Prophetic Visions\nIn the Hall of Warriors, Skid saw a storm tearing through the ley—the same pulse that marked him. Later, in the Heart Stone Chamber, had visions of world destruction if the ley anchors break.\n\n### Session 9 - The Heart Stone Chamber\nHis ley connection intensified during the vision in the Heart Stone Chamber. His presence helped stabilize the Eberron anchor, and he gained permanent ability to sense nearby ley currents.\n\n## Combat Role\n\nAs a Gloom Stalker Ranger, Skid excels at scouting, ambush tactics, and sustained ranged damage. With 120 ft. Darkvision and invisibility to creatures using darkvision while in darkness, he's the perfect reconnaissance specialist. The +9 Perception (Passive 19) means almost nothing escapes his notice. His Dreadful Strike adds burst damage, while the Slow mastery on his bow provides battlefield control."

The villagers famously melted all their gold into a bell and covered it with copper to hide its value—creating the legendary Bell of Shavras.\n\n## History\n\n### The Ancient Temple\nIn ancient times, Shavras was a thriving religious community. The temple served as a place of worship and housed a sacred bloodline that would later become the target of dark forces.\n\n### The Barbarian Raids\nAfter years of devastating barbarian attacks, the villagers devised a desperate plan. They melted all their gold, cast it into a bell, and covered it with copper to disguise its true value. The bell still sat atop the ruined shrine when the party arrived.\n\n### The Fall\nThe temple eventually fell into ruin. The Fallen Priest and his cult discovered the ancient secrets buried beneath and began working to open a portal to the Undergods using the blood of the last descendants.\n\n## The Bloodline of Shavras\n\nTwo important figures carry the bloodline of Shavras:\n- **Aidin Trynn** — The last known descendant of the temple founders. Her sacrifice was needed to open the portal.\n- **Greeve** — Unknowingly carried royal blood connected to Shavras. His death sealed the vault.\n\n## Current State\n\nThe surface ruins of Shavras are now largely collapsed. After the defeat of the Fallen Priest and Greeve's sacrifice, an entrance to the vault beneath opened briefly before being sealed by Greeve's transformation into a wraith guardian.\n\n## The Bell of Shavras\n\nThe legendary bell, worth 5,000gp in gold beneath its copper shell, was recovered by the party. Its ancient word \"Shavras\" in worn, raised lettering served as a key to unlock the hidden door in the Ulfandor mines.\n\n## Key Events\n\n### Session 4 - The Battle at Shavras\nThe party arrived to find a battle between Dain's dwarf clan and goblins/orcs. The Fallen Priest stood over Aidin on a stone slab, attempting the portal ritual. Greeve transformed into a Slaad and charged the shrine.\n\n### Session 5 - The Vault Opens\nAfter defeating the Fallen Priest, his body liquified and seeped into the earth, causing the ruins to shake and reveal an entrance to the vault beneath."

      "content": "## The Story So Far\n\nWhat began as a simple investigation into bandit raids in the frontier town of **Phandalin** has grown into a world-spanning quest to prevent catastrophe. Our party of six adventurers has faced undead priests, cursed forests, ancient dragons, and sinister cults—all while uncovering a conspiracy that threatens the very fabric of reality.\n\n## The Heroes\n\nOur tale follows six unlikely allies, now bound by fate and battle:\n\n- **Accoa Krigsdottir** — An Aasimar Paladin sworn to the Oath of the Ancients, she joined the party in the cursed Whisperwood Forest and has proven invaluable in their darkest hours.\n- **Kei Eaglesnout** — A Human Champion Fighter whose strength and determination anchor the party's front line (and who can't resist a good arm-wrestling competition).\n- **Malum Munus Exemplar** — A Half-Elf Assassin whose shadowy skills have gotten the party out of—and occasionally into—trouble.\n- **Rudiger** — A Human Evoker with a storm building inside him, learning to channel arcane power that even the Emerald Enclave has taken notice of.\n- **Skid Demon** — A Half-Elf Gloom Stalker Ranger marked by the leylines themselves, now able to sense the ancient currents that flow beneath the world.\n- **Stol** — A Human Life Domain Cleric whose faith has turned undead hordes and kept his companions standing when all seemed lost.\n\n## Arc One: The Fallen Priest & The Golden Bell of Shavras\n\nThe adventure began when the party was summoned to investigate raids on Phandalin's supply lines. What seemed like simple banditry soon revealed a darker purpose—a fallen priest seeking to open a gateway using the blood of an ancient lineage.\n\nThe heroes journeyed through the haunted **Whisperwood Forest**, faced a Night Hag's curse, and ultimately confronted the undead priest at the ruins of Shavras. There, they learned that **Aidin**, a simple village woman, was the last of a sacred bloodline. Her companion **Greeve** sacrificed himself to seal the vault, becoming its eternal guardian.\n\n## Arc Two: The Mawframe\n\nAfter sealing Shavras, the party arrived in **Astgrove** where they encountered **The Knock**, a faction of the Emerald Enclave. Rangers reported something unnatural in the North Woods—enslaved humans constructing a massive wooden structure that defied the laws of nature.\n\nThis structure is the **Maw Frame**, a resonance engine designed to awaken **Aru'xat the Verdant Maw**—an ancient primordial being sealed during the Dawn Wars. The Slanted Circle, a mysterious cult, seeks to unbind this world-devourer and remake reality in chaos.\n\nTo stop them, the party must anchor the leylines that keep Aru'xat imprisoned. This quest led them to:\n\n- **Stonehell Isle**, where they met **Nythraxil**, an ancient rose quartz dragon fused to stone, who gave them a crucial ley stone before falling to a Circle mage.\n- **Sharn, the City of Towers** in the plane of **Eberron**, where they infiltrated as Black Mantle operatives, only to discover traitors within the Enclave itself.\n- **The Dhakaani Ruins** beneath Sharn, where they stabilized a ley anchor in the heart of an ancient goblinoid empire.\n\n## What Lies Ahead\n\nThe Circle mage escaped, leaving only a cryptic sigil behind. Skid Demon now carries the mark of the leylines, able to sense their pulse across the world. The Enclave speaks of other anchors, other threats, and an enemy who seems always one step ahead.\n\nThe Maw Frame still rises in the Astralglades. Aru'xat stirs in his prison of root and stone. And somewhere in the shadows, the Slanted Circle continues their work.\n\nThe adventure continues.\n\n---\n\n*This campaign uses D&D 5th Edition rules and is run by our DM through D&D Beyond. Session summaries and character updates will be posted as our story unfolds.*"

The town had been plagued by raids on their supply lines, and worse—three villagers had been kidnapped, one already murdered. Rumors swirled that two of the missing, **Aidin** and **Greeve**, had been having an affair before their disappearance.\n\n## The Party\n\n- **Stol** — Human Cleric\n- **Rudiger** — Human Rogue\n- **Skid Demon** — Half-Elf Ranger\n- **Kei Eaglesnout** — Human Fighter\n- **Malum Munus Exemplar** — Half-Elf Rogue\n- **Cribben Hayduke** — Elf Druid\n\n## A Dwarf's Request\n\nOur meeting with Riglid was interrupted by **Dain Hemnulim**, a dwarf warrior seeking escort to Dalvenholm. He claimed goblins and orcs had overrun the Triboar Trail and separated him from his travel party. In exchange for safe passage, he pledged his services to our cause.\n\n## Drunk Goblins and Dark Omens\n\nSetting out from Phandalin, we encountered a burning cart and three drunken goblins attempting to extort us for ale. After dispatching them (Dain's great axe made quick work of the captives), one goblin revealed something troubling before his demise: *\"There is more to just supply raids... our master is looking for someone.\"*\n\nThe goblin carried a trinket—a small gold-colored bell on a chain, bearing the ancient word **\"Shavras\"** in worn, raised lettering.\n\n## The Fallenore Hot Springs\n\nWe arrived at the Fallenore Hot Springs, an ancient tiered waterfall cascading down a cliff. Two thieves—enslaved women fleeing an orc horde—attempted to rob us but quickly surrendered. They mentioned the town of **Ulfandor** and a *\"hidden door\"* before Stol's charity sent them safely on their way.\n\n## Rest at Gullborey\n\nThe session ended with the party purchasing potions at a small rest stop called Gullborey. A sleepy town with little to offer but an inn, tavern, and arcane shop.\n\nBut even here, the innkeeper's strange reaction to Dain gave us pause...\n\n---\n\n*What secrets does the Bell of Shavras hold? Who is the \"someone\" the goblins' master seeks? And what waits behind the hidden door of Ulfandor?*\n\n**Next Session:** The road to Umbrage Hill and the mysteries of Ulfandor await."

      "content": "## Umbrage Hill\n\nAfter departing Gullborey, our journey took us to **Umbrage Hill**—a place named for two feuding dwarf clans whose ancient grudge has been lost to time, leaving only cairns of the dead.\n\nAt the hill's stone windmill, we found a manticore attempting to break through the door while a woman cried for help from the second-story window. Rather than fight, we negotiated—offering the beast gold to find elsewhere to lair.\n\nThe grateful **Adabra Gwynn**, an apothecary, rewarded us with healing potions and entrusted us with a letter for Townmaster Riglid.\n\n## Ambush in the Night\n\nEn route to Ulfandor, Rudiger triggered a trap that showered pebbles from the trees—a goblin alarm. Torches emerged from the darkness as goblins attacked. We made quick work of them, but during the skirmish, we noticed something peculiar: Dain dressed his wounds with a handkerchief bearing the same symbology as the Bell of Shavras.\n\nHe claimed he'd lifted it from the thieves at the hot springs. We had our doubts.\n\n## The Mining Town of Ulfandor\n\n**Ulfandor** proved to be a bustling mining town—a stark contrast to sleepy Gullborey. The local tavern, the Stout Arrow, revealed that businesses were being extorted by an orc horde camping near the abandoned eastern mines.\n\nWe followed the orcs to the mine entrance and confronted them. Inside the abandoned mines, strange symbols covered the walls, leading to a circular room with a stone door marked by an etched sigil.\n\nDain lingered at the door, running his fingers over the carvings with an expression we couldn't read—reverence? Dread? He muttered something in an unfamiliar language.\n\n## Betrayal Revealed\n\nSuddenly, orcs and goblins burst into the cavern, led by a hulking chieftain and a terrifying robed figure—hovering, pale as death, with sunken eyes and tattered, bloodstained robes. **The Fallen Priest.**\n\nThe orc leader addressed Dain directly: *\"You've done well bringing them here, dwarf. Your debt is repaid—but your treachery ends now.\"*\n\nThe Fallen Priest's command echoed through the chamber: *\"Kill them all, secure the bloodline, and bring me the girl!\"*\n\nDain insisted his family had been held captive, forcing his conspiracy. But before he could name who they sought, the Priest raised two fingers—and Dain's tongue was ripped from his mouth, falling to the floor in a bloody mess. The Priest vanished.\n\n## Greeve's Testimony\n\nDespite his grievous wound, Dain fought alongside us as we defeated the remaining orcs and goblins. The Bell of Shavras opened the sealed door, revealing a captive man amid a room of symbols, bloody candles, and a bowl of smoldering eyeballs.\n\n**Greeve.** Weak and dirty, he kept repeating that he was *\"not the one\"* and needed to *\"find Aidin before they find her.\"*\n\nHis explanation chilled us to the bone: Aidin is the last of the bloodline of the ancient temple of Shavras. Her sacrifice will open the gateway.\n\n---\n\n*The Fallen Priest seeks to use Aidin's blood to unlock something terrible. But where is she? And what gateway does he mean to open?*\n\n**Next Session:** Into the cursed Whisperwood Forest we must go..."

      "content": "## Into the Cursed Wood\n\nStill reeling from Greeve's revelation, we learned that the only path to Shavras runs through **Whisperwood Forest**—a haunting place of despair and witchcraft, cursed by echoes of past atrocities. Greeve insisted we had no choice. To save Aidin, we must set aside fear.\n\nDain, unable to speak with his tongue torn out, wrote \"Home\" in blood on the mine wall. Greeve suggested he stay in Ulfandor to heal. We gave him Adabra's letter to deliver to Riglid in Phandalin.\n\nGreeve also revealed the truth about him and Aidin: they weren't having an affair. They had denounced their religion and were practicing ancient rituals in secret. A mysterious traveler had told Aidin her surname \"Trynn\" might connect her to the founders of Shavras. During a summer solstice ritual, the world went cold and dark—then they awoke in chains, prisoners of the orc horde.\n\n## The Forest That Watches\n\nAt Whisperwood's edge, an old robed man with a lantern warned us: *\"Beware the shifting paths of illusion. This way to the grove of lost souls.\"*\n\nThe forest lived up to its reputation:\n- The air grew colder with every step\n- Ghostly whispers echoed around us, sometimes taking familiar voices\n- Trees seemed to move when unobserved\n- A layer of ground fog swirled with every footstep\n\n## Grove of Lost Souls\n\nIn a clearing of scattered stone ruins and ancient gravestones, **six skeletal warriors** rose from the earth—tattered armor, rusted helmets, longswords drawn. Stol's Turn Undead repelled three of them, and we made quick work of the rest, though their bones exploded into damaging fragments when destroyed.\n\n## The Ossuary\n\nBeyond a wrought-iron gate, we found a stone structure under a blood-red moon. Inside lay thousands of bones and skulls wrapped in linen on marble slabs. As we explored, seven mummified corpses slowly rose and shuffled toward us.\n\nStol's holy power once again proved invaluable, repelling several zombies while we dispatched the rest. A crash of thunder and flash of lightning followed, then an evil laugh echoed through the ossuary as every candle suddenly ignited.\n\n## The Silent Boatman\n\nThe trail led to a fog-shrouded lake. A wooden raft emerged from the mist, steered by a robed figure who spoke no words—only motioned us aboard. Floating orbs of light drifted past as we crossed the phantom water.\n\nExhausted, we made camp on the far shore amid the forest's maddening symphony of whispers, cackling birds, and torrential rain.\n\n## The Night Hag's Deception\n\nMalum found a torn piece of fabric—Aidin's dress. Greeve touched it and received a vision: Aidin running, a group chasing her. Then Aidin's voice joined the forest whispers: *\"My dear Aidin, I am beyond the veil, beyond hope now. Do not come for me.\"*\n\nGiant spiders emerged from the shrubs. We defeated them easily—perhaps too easily.\n\nThen we saw her. A woman lying on the ground in a tattered dress. Greeve ran to her, crying *\"Aidin!\"* But when he touched her shoulder, her face contorted—revealing an elderly hag with wispy gray hair and a twisted pale face.\n\nAs Greeve levitated in agony, the **Night Hag** uttered her curse:\n\n> *\"Through roots that twist and shadows dance,*\n> *You will find no second chance.*\n> *Each step you take, the forest claims,*\n> *Your blood, your soul, your very name.*\n> *Turn back now, or face the cost—*\n> *All you love shall soon be lost.\"*\n\nLightning struck. The hag vanished. Greeve crumpled to the ground. And each of us felt our wisdom drain away as a vision of the dark priest invaded our minds.\n\n**We are cursed.**\n\n---\n\n*Cribben's fate was stranger still—the curse transformed him into a toad, and he hopped off into the forest, never to be seen again...*\n\n**Next Session:** Can we break the Hag's curse and reach Shavras in time?"

Inside, we found **Accoa Krigsdottir**, an Aasimar Paladin who had lost her way while scouting goblins near Kryptgarden Forest. She had taken refuge from the storm.\n\nFrom the top of the watchtower, we glimpsed hope—the edge of Whisperwood gave way to sweeping plains of light-tufted grasslands awash in midday sunshine.\n\n## Under Siege\n\nOur relief was short-lived. Loud chanting rose from below, and we saw torches approaching—**nine cultists** bearing sickles and flames. They set the watchtower ablaze.\n\nIn the thick of battle, something miraculous happened. A massive tree fell on four cultists, killing them instantly. But the tree was *moving*—and from within it emerged the shape of a woman.\n\n## Erinthin of the Moonwoods\n\nAfter the battle calmed, the Dryad **Erinthin** communicated with us through Accoa's Speak with Animals spell:\n\n> *\"I am Erinthin, a Dryad of the Moonwoods. This evil has soured these woods for far too long. I watched as the Witch cursed your party, and I will attempt to break her wretched spell.\"*\n\nTrue to her word, Erinthin lifted the Night Hag's curse—our wisdom was restored. She also gave us three gifts:\n\n- **Longbow +1** with five thorn-bloom arrows that cause extra damage\n- **Nature's Mantle** — a cloak that shifts color to blend with terrain\n- **Three Imbued Acorns** — when planted, they sprout saplings of Erinthin's bonded tree\n\nHer final words guided our path: *\"My kin tell me you are after the Priest? He travels in shadow, between this world and soon another if he has his way. You are not far from Shavras.\"*\n\n## The Night Hag's Last Stand\n\nLeaving Whisperwood at last, we came to a bridge where a traveling merchant awaited. But as we approached, the merchant transformed—revealing the **Night Hag** once more.\n\n*\"This is not the way. Right or left, one of which will lead to death.\"*\n\nShe attacked, claws slashing. But this time, we were ready. **Kei** dealt the killing blow and released her **Soul Bag**, freeing the tormented spirits she had collected over centuries.\n\n## The Shrine of Shavras\n\nAt the top of the hill beyond the bridge, an open field spread before us—and in the distance stood the ruins of the **Shrine of Shavras**. But the field was chaos.\n\n**Dain** and his dwarf clan were locked in battle with goblins and orcs. Near the shrine itself, the Fallen Priest stood over a woman's body laid upon a stone slab—**Aidin**. Behind them, a circle of stone glowed red.\n\nAnd then Greeve... transformed. His body twisted into a lizard-like creature—a **Gray Slaad**—and charged toward the shrine.\n\nThe final confrontation had begun.\n\n---\n\n*With Aidin's life hanging in the balance and the Fallen Priest attempting his dark ritual, we must fight through an army to reach the shrine. But what has become of Greeve?*\n\n**Next Session:** The Battle of Shavras."

Behind him, the portal shimmered with red energy.\n\nAs we battled the skeletal knights flanking him, a massive shadow passed overhead—a **white dragon** soaring away from the battle. We had no time to wonder why.\n\nThe fight was brutal. Stol fell and was restored by Rudiger. But together we chipped away at the Priest's unholy defenses, defeating his acolytes while simultaneously confronting the Fallen Priest himself.\n\nAt last, we struck him down. The portal crumbled. **Aidin was saved**—weak, but alive.\n\n## The Legend of the Golden Bell\n\nAfter the battle, Greeve—restored from his Slaad transformation—explained what he knew. The traveler who had come to Phandalin told them of an ancient legend: when barbarians repeatedly sacked Shavras, the villagers melted all their gold into a bell and covered it with copper to hide its value.\n\nThe **Bell of Shavras** still sat atop the ruined shrine—5,000 gold pieces covered in 1,000 copper pieces. Along with it, we claimed:\n\n- **Devotee's Censer**\n- **Circlet of Blasting**\n- **Mace of Disruption**\n- **Throwing Axe +1**\n\n## Something Awakens Below\n\nAs we approached Aidin, the Priest's body liquified and seeped into the earth. The ground shook. Ruins collapsed. When the dust settled, a dark entrance had opened—leading into the depths of Shavras.\n\nAidin sat up, eyes wide: *\"Something old is awakening. We must put an end to this.\"*\n\n## The Dungeon Beneath\n\nShadows flickered on the walls, replaying the last moments of ancient priests who had sealed this place:\n\n> *\"The bloodline must remain unbroken...\"*\n> *\"We were betrayed... the last of the faithful... slaughtered...\"*\n> *\"If the seal fails... the world will burn...\"*\n\nWe descended, fighting our way through goblin warriors, skeletal warriors, a hulking ogre, and giant spiders. Each chamber held treasures:\n\n- **Ring of Protection**\n- **Battering Shield**\n- **Bag of Holding**\n- **Pipes of Haunting**\n\nWe found murals depicting sacred bloodlines—Greeve noticed one crest similar to his own family's. The Priest's voice echoed: *\"The portal of the Undergods will be defended at all costs!\"*\n\n## The Heart of Shavras\n\nIn the final chamber, purple light pulsed from a floating box containing a heart. The room shook violently, and a massive dark shade took the form of the Priest once more.\n\n*\"The power of the old gods is beyond your wildest dreams. Pledge to the ancients and you will wield its power.\"*\n\nFour skeletal warriors rose from the ground—the actual remains of ancient buried priests. We fought desperately while Aidin chanted in the corner, Greeve shielding her with his body.\n\nThen Greeve kissed Aidin on the back of her head, stood, and charged the wraith.\n\n## The Guardian's Sacrifice\n\nThe Priest's bone sword impaled Greeve. *\"A bastard's blood may be as thin as water, but it still carries the weight of a crown.\"*\n\nGreeve slid off the blade and crumpled to the ground.\n\nWe banished the undead priest. Aidin ran to Greeve's side.\n\nWith his dying breath, Greeve spoke: *\"My family never told me of their royal blood, but my death will only seal the vault until they track down all of my ancestors. Go. My fate is now tied here.\"*\n\n**Greeve became a wraith—the eternal guardian of the vault of Shavras.**\n\nThe walls began to crumble. We escaped with our lives, our loot, and the knowledge that one chapter had ended.\n\n---\n\n*The Fallen Priest is destroyed. The vault of Shavras is sealed—guarded forever by Greeve's sacrifice. But what of Aidin? And what ancient evil first corrupted the Priest?*\n\n**Arc One Complete.**\n\n**Next Session:** A new threat emerges in Astgrove..."

About three miles distant lay **Astgrove**, a large sub-alpine town of roughly 3,000 villagers—a welcome sight after our ordeal.\n\nWe sold some gems to a jeweler for 6,000 gold, commissioned custom plate armor, purchased weapons, and visited the arcane shop for **Eyes of the Eagle** and **Goggles of Night**.\n\n## The Knock\n\nOutside the tavern called The Mason and the Chain, a man stumbled into us—shot in the leg by an arrow. Rangers in forest green approached calmly, one scooping up the wounded man. They wore leaf pendants on their right breasts.\n\nTheir leader, **Harlix Darkleaf**, leaned close to Skid, hand on dagger: *\"What would you be doing with a Dryad's bow?\"*\n\nWe explained our encounter with Erinthin in Whisperwood. Harlix's demeanor shifted immediately: *\"On behalf of the Emerald Enclave, you have our admiration for aiding our woodland friends. Please, join us for a pint.\"*\n\nInside the tavern, Harlix explained: *\"We are brothers of The Knock—protectors of the wildlands, friends of the forest. We are a faction of the Emerald Enclave, drawn here by unnatural forces in the North Woods of the Astralglades.\"*\n\nHe invited us to accompany them that night. We accepted.\n\n## Goblin Ambush\n\nEn route, we encountered goblin riders and a goblin wizard attacking from a ridge. Rudiger and Harlix proved devastating, and we pressed on without delay.\n\n## Horror in the Astralglades\n\nWhat we found defied comprehension.\n\nA large group of **enslaved humans** were being forced to build a massive wooden structure by cutting down the ancient forest. Purple-robed figures watched over them. Lines of glowing blue energy surrounded the structure. Rocks rolled *uphill*, defying gravity.\n\nThe wooden construction resembled the jaw of a giant creature.\n\n**The Maw Frame.**\n\nHarlix insisted we retreat immediately. This required the attention of the full Enclave.\n\n## Kei's Victory\n\nBack in Astgrove, Kei entered an arm-wrestling competition at the tavern—defeating three of four competitors and winning **400 gold pieces**.\n\nBut our minds remained on what we'd witnessed in the North Woods. What were those robed figures building? Why did they need slaves? And what creature's jaw was that structure meant to represent?\n\n---\n\n*The Emerald Enclave has taken notice of us. But the horror of the Maw Frame lingers. What ancient force is being summoned in the Astralglades?*\n\n**Next Session:** An audience with the High Council reveals the terrible truth..."

We were given supplies—silvered arrows and rations—before being introduced to **Rook Targrave**, a stern member of the High Council.\n\nHis words were blunt:\n\n> *\"You aren't here because you defeated some wayward heretic. What you witnessed in the Astralglades is a force greater than anything you could imagine—an ancient being, a builder of worlds, being summoned to rip this world apart.*\n>\n> *Those robed men are the **Slanted Circle**. What the slaves construct is the **Throat of Aru'xat**—a resonance engine designed to awaken a slumbering primordial beast. **Aru'xat the Verdant Maw**, the Feeder of Forests, a serpentine entity sealed during the Dawn Wars when the gods first planted life. It once devoured entire worlds.*\n>\n> *The Circle attempts to align ley lines to wake it. You must find the ancient beings who can help us anchor those ley lines. Most notably: **Nythraxil**, a rose quartz dragon banished to Stonehell Isle.\"*\n\nRook pulled Rudiger aside afterward, sensing the young wizard's internal conflict. He handed him a scroll of Lightning Resistance: *\"The storm within us can manifest out if we are not careful.\"*\n\n## Journey to Stonehell\n\nWe traveled through the Astralglades toward Muck Bay, where **Captain Tallow** awaited with his ship, the Siren's Song. Along the way:\n\n- A **Frost Elemental** emerged from ley-scarred flowers, warning that the world's balance was shifting. It gave us an amulet teaching the Frost Fingers spell.\n- We were ambushed by men bearing Slanted Circle markings.\n\n## The Kraken Attack\n\nAt sea, pirates attacked from the fog. But mid-battle, a **kraken** erupted from the depths, grabbing pirates and smashing ships. The pirate vessel's explosives detonated, severing a tentacle and dealing massive damage.\n\nThrough it all, a mage on the pirate ship stared at Captain Tallow before diving into the water and vanishing.\n\nTallow revealed he was a druid of Eberron and had banished the kraken—but the mage had escaped on his own. *\"That mage is not far behind. I sensed his confusion about Stonehell's location. The island is hidden by enchanted mist.\"*\n\n## Nythraxil's Lair\n\nTallow's ritual parted the mist, revealing Stonehell Isle's massive stone spires. We fought through giant vultures to reach the lair at the summit.\n\nBefore meeting the dragon, we were required to release memories into crystal pools—the dragon \"sees\" mortals through their memories.\n\n**Nythraxil** lay on his side—a hulking mass of red, pink, and white quartz. So ancient his body had fused to the stone itself.\n\n> *\"Aru'xat... a name I hoped would stay buried. You require the ley stone? Like my body, it too has fused to the quartz. The ley stone will only anchor the ley lines in the Astralglades. The Slanted Circle will seek other anchors. The Jundites of Eberron will have the key of Agmon. Seek the word of Ildrar, a cleric of the ancient race of Orondin.\"*\n\n## The Mage Returns\n\nA massive blast shattered stone above the dragon. The mage from the shipwreck had found us.\n\nNythraxil thrashed in startled rage, breathing fire. The mage's ice blast missed the dragon but struck a stone pillar above—it froze and fell, severing Nythraxil's wing.\n\nWith his last breath, the ancient dragon unleashed fire at the mage, sending him tumbling down the mountain. Then Nythraxil fell silent forever.\n\n**Rudiger secured the ley stone.** We defeated the mage and returned to Captain Tallow.\n\n## Return to Astgrove\n\nBack in Astgrove, we reluctantly handed the ley stone to Rook and the Enclave. We told him what Nythraxil had said about Eberron.\n\nRook nodded gravely. Our next journey would take us to another plane entirely.\n\n---\n\n*Nythraxil is dead. The Circle mage escaped once, but we have the ley stone. Now we must travel to Eberron—a different plane of existence—to find the next anchor.*\n\n**Next Session:** Journey to Sharn, the City of Towers..."

The ley stone would power our journey.\n\nBut we wouldn't travel as ourselves.\n\n> *\"You will travel under the guise of operatives of The Black Mantle—a shadowy espionage syndicate feared in Sharn's underworlds. Your faces, your papers, your deeds. Play the role well, or be unmasked.\"*\n\n**Alkanar**, the Enclave's elderly Dragonborn historian, briefed us on Sharn: the City of Towers, built atop ancient Dhakaani goblinoid ruins. A vertical city of five plateaus, where the Lightning Rail connects distant lands.\n\nWe were blindfolded, led to the Keyport, and teleported through folding light and rushing voices.\n\n## Arrival in Sharn\n\nWe landed hard in a tavern backroom. Tobacco smoke, cheap brandy, the tang of iron. A sealed envelope waited on a scarred table, pressed with a black wax sigil of crossed swords.\n\nThe barkeep's nervous voice: *\"Black Mantle... your reputation precedes you.\"*\n\nThe letter directed us to the **Cornerstone Tavern** in Callestan—ask for the house game of \"Iron and Ash.\" Our contact would find us.\n\n## The Cornerstone\n\nThe Cornerstone was built around a fighting pit where mercenaries brawled for gamblers' entertainment. We took our seats and ordered drinks.\n\nA serving girl approached—but her face flickered. Too-sharp eyes, a smile that didn't quite fit. A **changeling**.\n\nShe whispered: *\"Mantle. You're late. And the Circle is already moving. Meet me outside in 25 minutes.\"*\n\nBefore she vanished into the smoke, thugs surrounded our table. One slammed a dagger into the wood: *\"Funny thing—the Mantle don't walk Sharn no more. So who are you wearing their faces?\"*\n\n## The Chase\n\nDuring the brawl, three men in purple scarves—**Slanted Circle agents**—slipped through the chaos. A pickpocket stole our letter.\n\nStol and Kei finished the thugs while the rest of us gave chase through Callestan's narrow streets, bazaars, and angry vendors. Accoa finally stunned the runner.\n\nHis only words: *\"The stone sang your path. He sees.\"*\n\nOn his person: a torn logbook page in druidic script mentioning a Dragonshard shipment via the Lightning Rail, and a crystal shard keyed to a scrying focus. **Someone was watching through it.**\n\n## Verdant Hollow\n\nOur changeling contact, **Veyra**, led us to her cipher contact in the black markets—**Yog**, a one-eyed goblin. Under intimidation, he revealed that a scarred mage had paid well for a druidic cipher book and mentioned \"Verdant Hollow.\"\n\nBefore he could say more, an arrow split his skull.\n\nWe fought off Circle warriors and fled to **Verdant Hollow**—the local Emerald Enclave chapter, hidden in a hollowed tower garden.\n\n## Traitors Revealed\n\nThe Enclave druids were divided—half believed we'd planted the forged druidic note, half feared a traitor within. Elder **Elarion Mossbark** pulled us aside:\n\n> *\"A druidic cipher was stolen two days ago. I saw a tall man in Enclave robes near the black market. His name was 'Harlix.' I have someone tailing him.\"*\n\nHe also warned that the ley shard we carried was tracking our movements more than our Black Mantle disguise. *\"The suggestion of Mantle operatives was so your presence could be more easily tracked.\"*\n\n## Lightning Rail\n\nWe headed to Tavick's Landing to intercept the Dragonshard shipment. Near the cargo platform, we spotted him: **Harlix**, hood drawn, speaking with a rail agent.\n\nThen he stepped from the shadows and removed his hood.\n\n> *\"You should have stayed blind. The anchors bind more than Aru'xat—they bind the world! I would see those chains broken, even if it means burning every bridge.\"*\n\nThe rail agent's face shifted. **Veyra.**\n\n> *\"Did you truly think I was your ally? Every step, every whisper—I fed to the Circle. You weren't Mantle. You were marionettes.\"*\n\nWe were shoved aboard the train. After battling Night Watch guards and Circle agents (Rudiger's fireball was particularly effective), we confronted Harlix and Veyra in the engine room.\n\nHarlix fought with conflicted respect. Veyra taunted us with half-truths about the Enclave. In the end, **Veyra died** and **Harlix surrendered**.\n\nHis confession: the Eberron ley anchor lies deep in the Dhakaani dungeons beneath Sharn. The Circle mage intends to reach it, backed by a Dragonmarked House.\n\n---\n\n*Harlix and Veyra were traitors all along. But we have the Dragonshards and know where the anchor lies. Now we must descend into ancient goblinoid ruins beneath Sharn.*\n\n**Next Session:** Into the depths of the Dhakaani Empire..."

The memory of the ley gate burned in our minds—we remembered stepping through together, but something had gone wrong.\n\nA hand jutted from collapsed tunnel rubble. **Skid Demon** dragged himself free, armor crackling with static, blade still glowing from ley discharge.\n\nHis eyes flashed white: *\"The ley current split. I fell through like a crack in glass. I saw lines—rivers of light leading to a heart of stone. Something's moving beneath. Watching. Waiting.\"*\n\nThree dwarven warriors approached, led by **Master Molrik**: *\"We felt a flux of ley energy from half a mile away.\"*\n\nOne dwarf, Glun, stared at Skid in astonishment as ley energy arced around him: *\"Stone-born.\"*\n\n## Into the Deep\n\nMolrik's clan took custody of Harlix and the Dragonshards, then led us through a collapsed tunnel into the depths beneath Sharn. Ancient dwarven forges lit by magma streams. Anvils and bellows from an age before memory.\n\nAt a sealed archway carved with Dhakaani script, Molrik stopped: *\"Beyond this door lies the old empire. The ley runs strongest there. You'll feel it in your bones.\"*\n\nSkid felt the pulse sync with his heartbeat. He had become a living compass.\n\n## The Hall of Warriors\n\nThe Dhakaani ruins stretched before us—statues of hobgoblin warriors bearing inscriptions: *\"Hold the line.\" \"The war is eternal.\" \"Guard the heart.\"*\n\nThe leyline's hum deepened. Stone warped. Colors shifted. We blinked and the hall came alive—hobgoblin soldiers marching in perfect formation, banners blazing crimson and gold. They marched through us like ghosts.\n\n**The Hall remembered its last war.**\n\nEach of us experienced visions:\n- **Stol** saw himself as a Dhakaani soldier\n- **Kei** felt the weight of command and failure\n- **Skid** saw a storm tearing through the ley—the same pulse that had marked him\n\nThe floor dropped away, hurling us into the next level.\n\n## Trials of the Dhakaani\n\nWe fought through chamber after chamber:\n\n**The Hall of Seals** — Rune-trapped tiles sliced us with force-field blades until we deciphered the correct path.\n\n**The War Scholars' Quarters** — Three Dhakaani Wraith-Tacticians rose from the shadows. Stol's Turn Undead sent them recoiling. Their death whisper: *\"The heart below must never fall...\"*\n\n**The Gauntlet of Stone & Shadow** — Six undead hobgoblin warriors attacked methodically, followed by two Stonebound Guardians and a Shadow Captain whose body dissolved into ash, leaving a command token pointing toward the final chamber.\n\n## The Heart Stone Chamber\n\nA spiral stair descended into a cathedral-like chamber. In the center rose a black obsidian monolith, veined with pulsing light, throbbing like a heartbeat. Twelve statues of hobgoblin generals surrounded it. Ley conduits snaked into the walls, vanishing into infinity.\n\nA voice spoke within our skulls: *\"The Heart endures. Who commands the stone?\"*\n\n**General Varkuun** erupted from the ground—the last Dhakaani warlord, encased in ley-crystal armor, eyes burning blue.\n\n*\"You come for the Heart. As we once did. Prove your right, or perish.\"*\n\nWe used the ley conduits to channel extra damage, and finally brought the ancient general to his knees. His last words: *\"You are the last commanders. Guard what we could not.\"*\n\n## The Circle Mage\n\nAs the Anchor's core opened, a figure stepped from the light—the **Circle Mage**, sigil burned into his tattered robes, eyes glowing with ley reflection.\n\n*\"You've done what even my peers dared not—touched the Heart itself.\"*\n\nThen he vanished, leaving only a glowing sigil burned into the floor.\n\n## Skid's Vision\n\nLight surged from the monolith. Skid went rigid, eyes white with leyfire. He stood alone in an endless cavern of glass and shadow, ley lines pulsing with his heartbeat. Through the cracks, something vast shifted beneath the earth.\n\nA voice rose from the ley:\n\n> *\"If the pulse breaks, the world will bleed.\"*\n> *\"The roots that bind will tear, and the sky will burn.\"*\n> *\"Stabilize the pulse, and the heart will sleep again.\"*\n\nHe saw Sharn's towers collapsing. Oceans boiling. Forests splitting along glowing fault lines.\n\n## Balance Restored\n\nSkid shared what he'd seen: *\"I saw what happens if we pull it free. Everything breaks. The ley runs through the bones of the world. We keep it steady, or we all fall with it.\"*\n\nWorking together, we stabilized the anchor. The light steadied. The hum faded to a deep, even pulse. The fractures sealed into glowing veins.\n\n**The leyline beneath Sharn grew calm.**\n\nSkid's ley mark now glows faintly—he can sense nearby ley currents. The Dhakaani statues bowed as motes of light rose from their eyes: *\"Balance restored.\"*\n\n## Return\n\nWe ascended to Molrik's forward camp and returned the dwarven war banners we'd found. The Molrik clan rewarded us with magical items and their eternal respect.\n\nThe Eberron anchor is stable. But the Circle Mage escaped. The Maw Frame still rises in the Astralglades. And somewhere, **Aru'xat the Verdant Maw** stirs in his ancient prison.\n\nThe fight continues.\n\n---\n\n*One anchor secured. More remain. The Circle Mage left only a sigil behind—what does it mean? And what will Skid's new connection to the leylines reveal?*\n\n**The adventure continues...**"

What we discovered was far more sinister: an ancient cult, a fallen priest, and artifacts tied to the dark god Shavras.\n\nAfter sealing the Vault of Shavras and defeating the Fallen Priest, we learned of an even greater threat: **Aru'xat the Verdant Maw**, a primordial world-devourer that the Slanted Circle seeks to awaken using the Maw Frame.\n\nOur quest has taken us from the haunted depths of Whisperwood Forest to the towering spires of Sharn in Eberron, where we've fought to protect the ley anchors that keep the world intact.\n\n## The Party\n\n- **Stol** - Human Cleric (Life Domain) - Our steadfast healer\n- **Rudiger** - Human Wizard (Evoker) - Master of arcane destruction\n- **Skid Demon** - Half-Elf Ranger (Gloom Stalker) - Now marked by ley energy\n- **Kei Eaglesnout** - Human Fighter (Champion) - Our stalwart frontline\n- **Malum Munus Exemplar** - Half-Elf Rogue (Assassin) - Striking from the shadows\n- **Accoa Krigsdottir** - Aasimar Paladin (Oath of the Ancients) - Divine warrior\n\n## What You'll Find Here\n\nThis blog chronicles our tabletop adventures:\n\n- **[Session Chronicles](/sessions)** - Detailed recaps of every session from the beginning\n- **[Campaign Reference](/reference)** - Characters, locations, factions, and lore\n\n## The Journey Continues\n\nWith nine sessions behind us and the Eberron ley anchor now stabilized, our party prepares for what comes next. The Slanted Circle's burned mage still lurks in the shadows, and there are more anchors to protect before Aru'xat can be stopped for good.\n\nRoll well, and may your natural 20s be plentiful!\n\n---\n\n*\"The story has just begun...\"*\n\n---\n\n<small>This site is automatically built and deployed via GitHub Actions CI/CD.</small>"
