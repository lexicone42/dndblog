## The Ley Anchor Quest

### Purpose
- Anchor ley lines to prevent Aru'xat's awakening
- Multiple anchors exist across planes
- Each must be found and secured/stabilized

### Anchors Status

| Anchor | Location | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Astralglades | Stonehell Isle | SECURED - Ley stone obtained from Nythraxil |
| Eberron | Beneath Sharn (Dhakaani ruins) | SECURED - Stabilized in Session 9 |
| Unknown | Eberron - Jundites territory | PENDING - Nythraxil mentioned "Key of Agmon" |
| Unknown | Unknown | PENDING - More anchors implied |

### Guidance
- Nythraxil: "Seek the word of Ildrar, a cleric of the ancient race of Orondin"
- The Jundites of Eberron have the Key of Agmon

## The Circle Mage

### Identity
- Unknown name
- Powerful ice mage
- Sigil burned into robes (same sigil left on Heart Stone Chamber floor)
- Eyes glow with ley reflection

### Encounters
1. **Kraken Battle**: Observed Captain Tallow, escaped by diving into water
2. **Stonehell Isle**: Killed Nythraxil, survived fall down mountain
3. **Heart Stone Chamber**: Appeared when anchor core opened, vanished leaving only sigil

### Current Status

## Arc One: The Fallen Priest (RESOLVED)

### The Threat
- Priest was opening portal to the Undergods
- Using Aidin for ritual sacrifice
- Base at Shrine of Shavras

### Resolution
- Priest defeated twice (physical form and shade form)
- Vault of Shavras sealed
- Greeve sacrificed himself to become eternal guardian
- Portal to Undergods permanently closed

### Loose Threads
- White dragon Ulfandor was present at final battle - why?
- Connection between Undergods and Aru'xat/Dawn Wars?
- Greeve's royal bloodline - are there other descendants the enemy might target?
