## Arc Two Begins: The Mawframe

Through the other side of Shavras's chamber, we emerged into a small valley. About three miles distant lay **Astgrove**, a large sub-alpine town of roughly 3,000 villagers—a welcome sight after our ordeal.

We sold some gems to a jeweler for 6,000 gold, commissioned custom plate armor, purchased weapons, and visited the arcane shop for **Eyes of the Eagle** and **Goggles of Night**.

## The Knock

Outside the tavern called The Mason and the Chain, a man stumbled into us—shot in the leg by an arrow. Rangers in forest green approached calmly, one scooping up the wounded man. They wore leaf pendants on their right breasts.

Their leader, **Harlix Darkleaf**, leaned close to Skid, hand on dagger: *"What would you be doing with a Dryad's bow?"*

We explained our encounter with Erinthin in Whisperwood. Harlix's demeanor shifted immediately: *"On behalf of the Emerald Enclave, you have our admiration for aiding our woodland friends. Please, join us for a pint."*

Inside the tavern, Harlix explained: *"We are brothers of The Knock—protectors of the wildlands, friends of the forest. We are a faction of the Emerald Enclave, drawn here by unnatural forces in the North Woods of the Astralglades."*

He invited us to accompany them that night. We accepted.

## Goblin Ambush

En route, we encountered goblin riders and a goblin wizard attacking from a ridge. Rudiger and Harlix proved devastating, and we pressed on without delay.

## Horror in the Astralglades

What we found defied comprehension.

A large group of **enslaved humans** were being forced to build a massive wooden structure by cutting down the ancient forest. Purple-robed figures watched over them. Lines of glowing blue energy surrounded the structure. Rocks rolled *uphill*, defying gravity.

The wooden construction resembled the jaw of a giant creature.

**The Maw Frame.**

Harlix insisted we retreat immediately. This required the attention of the full Enclave.

## Kei's Victory

Back in Astgrove, Kei entered an arm-wrestling competition at the tavern—defeating three of four competitors and winning **400 gold pieces**.

But our minds remained on what we'd witnessed in the North Woods. What were those robed figures building? Why did they need slaves? And what creature's jaw was that structure meant to represent?

*The Emerald Enclave has taken notice of us. But the horror of the Maw Frame lingers. What ancient force is being summoned in the Astralglades?*

**Next Session:** An audience with the High Council reveals the terrible truth...
