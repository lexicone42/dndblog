# The Story So Far

A party of adventurers investigated what they thought were simple bandit raids in the frontier town of Phandalin. They were wrong about everything.

---

## What Actually Happened

It started with kidnappings. Then a golden bell inscribed with a name no one recognized—**Shavras**. Then a vault beneath the earth, a fallen priest, and a woman whose bloodline had been hunted for centuries.

They sealed the vault. They thought they'd won.

*They hadn't.*

The Vault of Shavras was a lock. They'd just confirmed that somewhere, a key existed.

---

## What They Learned

In **Astgrove**, rangers of the Emerald Enclave spoke of something wrong in the North Woods. Trees cut against their will. Rocks rolling uphill. Enslaved humans building a structure that resembled a jaw.

They called it **The Maw Frame**.

A resonance engine. A wooden machine designed to do one thing: wake **Aru'xat the Verdant Maw**—a primordial entity sealed during the Dawn Wars. Something old enough to have eaten worlds before this one existed.

The ones building it? A cult called **The Slanted Circle**. Purple robes. Ice magic. Operatives embedded in every organization that might stop them.

They've been planning this for a very long time.

## The Party

Five remain. Not heroes—not yet. Just the ones still standing when everything started falling apart.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stol** | Human Cleric. Life Domain. Keeps the others standing. |
| **Rudiger** | Human Wizard. Evoker. Storm building inside. |
| **Skid Demon** | Half-Elf Ranger. Gloom Stalker. *Marked by the leylines now.* |
| **Malum Munus Exemplar** | Half-Elf Rogue. Assassin. Works from the dark. |
| **Accoa Krigsdottir** | Aasimar Paladin. Oath of the Ancients. Light in bad places. |

*[Kei Eaglesnout](/campaign/characters/kei) left in Session 11 to found the [Eaglesnout Academy](/eaglesnout-academy). His tartan remains with each party member—a reminder that he didn't leave them alone. He left them stronger.*

## The Current Situation

**Eleven sessions recorded.**

The party has traveled from Phandalin to the cursed depths of **Whisperwood Forest**, to the ancient rose-quartz dragon **Nythraxil** on Stonehell Isle, to the planar city of **Sharn** in Eberron. There, beneath a million towers, in ruins of the **Dhakaani Empire**, they stabilized a ley anchor that had been cracking for millennia.

Now they've gone further—across the Thunder Sea aboard Captain Tallow's airship **The Stormlight**, fighting through a Slanted Circle ambush in the sky, to land in the untamed jungles of **Xen'Drik**.

They lost a friend along the way. Not to death—to duty. Kei left to rebuild what he'd lost and build something new. The party carries pieces of his tartan now. Reminders.

Skid's eyes glow. The leylines pulse beneath the jungle floor. The Circle is here, ahead of them. And whatever they're looking for in Xen'Drik—it's bad enough they sent an airship to stop the party from finding it first.

The Maw Frame still rises in the Astralglades. More anchors need protection. The adventure continues.

## Where to Go Next

**Start with the sessions.** Read them in order. Watch six strangers become a team. Watch the mystery unfold.

- **[Session 1: The Bell of Shavras](/blog/session-01-the-bell-of-shavras)** — It starts with missing people and ends with a name that shouldn't exist.
- **[All Sessions](/sessions)** — The full chronological record. Some nights were victories. Some were barely survivals.

**Or explore the world.**

- **[The Reference Index](/reference)** — Every character, location, faction, and item the party has encountered. Cross-referenced and searchable.
- **[The Party](/campaign/characters/)** — Meet the adventurers in detail.
