# Welcome, Adventurers!

Welcome to **Chronicles of the Mawframe**, the official campaign journal for our ongoing D&D 5th Edition adventure. What started as a simple investigation into bandit raids has grown into an epic tale spanning multiple planes of existence.

## Our Story So Far

Our party of adventurers first met in the frontier town of Phandalin, summoned to investigate raids and kidnappings. What we discovered was far more sinister: an ancient cult, a fallen priest, and artifacts tied to the dark god Shavras.

After sealing the Vault of Shavras and defeating the Fallen Priest, we learned of an even greater threat: **Aru'xat the Verdant Maw**, a primordial world-devourer that the Slanted Circle seeks to awaken using the Maw Frame.

Our quest has taken us from the haunted depths of Whisperwood Forest to the towering spires of Sharn in Eberron, where we've fought to protect the ley anchors that keep the world intact.

## The Party

- **Stol** - Human Cleric (Life Domain) - Our steadfast healer
- **Rudiger** - Human Wizard (Evoker) - Master of arcane destruction
- **Skid Demon** - Half-Elf Ranger (Gloom Stalker) - Now marked by ley energy
- **Kei Eaglesnout** - Human Fighter (Champion) - Our stalwart frontline
- **Malum Munus Exemplar** - Half-Elf Rogue (Assassin) - Striking from the shadows
- **Accoa Krigsdottir** - Aasimar Paladin (Oath of the Ancients) - Divine warrior

## What You'll Find Here

This blog chronicles our tabletop adventures:

- **[Session Chronicles](/sessions)** - Detailed recaps of every session from the beginning
- **[Campaign Reference](/reference)** - Characters, locations, factions, and lore

## The Journey Continues

With nine sessions behind us and the Eberron ley anchor now stabilized, our party prepares for what comes next. The Slanted Circle's burned mage still lurks in the shadows, and there are more anchors to protect before Aru'xat can be stopped for good.

Roll well, and may your natural 20s be plentiful!
