# You Found This

These are the recovered field notes of six individuals who investigated what they thought were simple bandit raids in the frontier town of Phandalin.

They were wrong about everything.

---

## What Actually Happened

It started with kidnappings. Then a golden bell inscribed with a name no one recognized—**Shavras**. Then a vault beneath the earth, a fallen priest, and a woman whose bloodline had been hunted for centuries.

They sealed the vault. They thought they'd won.

*They hadn't.*

The Vault of Shavras was a lock. They'd just confirmed that somewhere, a key existed.

---

## What They Learned

In **Astgrove**, rangers of the Emerald Enclave spoke of something wrong in the North Woods. Trees cut against their will. Rocks rolling uphill. Enslaved humans building a structure that resembled a jaw.

They called it **The Maw Frame**.

A resonance engine. A wooden machine designed to do one thing: wake **Aru'xat the Verdant Maw**—a primordial entity sealed during the Dawn Wars. Something old enough to have eaten worlds before this one existed.

The ones building it? A cult called **The Slanted Circle**. Purple robes. Ice magic. Operatives embedded in every organization that might stop them.

They've been planning this for a very long time.

## The Party

Six people. Not heroes—not yet. Just the ones who happened to be there when everything started falling apart.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stol** | Human Cleric. Life Domain. Keeps the others standing. |
| **Rudiger** | Human Wizard. Evoker. Storm building inside. |
| **Skid Demon** | Half-Elf Ranger. Gloom Stalker. *Marked by the leylines now.* |
| **Kei Eaglesnout** | Human Fighter. Champion. Won't let go. |
| **Malum Munus Exemplar** | Half-Elf Rogue. Assassin. Works from the dark. |
| **Accoa Krigsdottir** | Aasimar Paladin. Oath of the Ancients. Light in bad places. |

## The Current Situation

**Ten sessions recorded.**

The party has traveled from Phandalin to the cursed depths of **Whisperwood Forest**, to the ancient rose-quartz dragon **Nythraxil** on Stonehell Isle, to the planar city of **Sharn** in Eberron.

There, beneath a million towers, in ruins of the **Dhakaani Empire**, they stabilized a ley anchor that had been cracking for millennia.

The Circle Mage escaped. Left only a sigil burned into stone.

Skid's eyes glow now. He can feel the pulse of the leylines like a second heartbeat.

The Maw Frame still rises in the Astralglades. More anchors need protection. And somewhere in the dark, the Slanted Circle prepares their next move.
