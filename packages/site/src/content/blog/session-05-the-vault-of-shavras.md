## The Battle for Shavras

The Fallen Priest hovered above Aidin, chanting in an incomprehensible tongue. Hundreds of blood-dripping candles surrounded them. Behind him, the portal shimmered with red energy.

As we battled the skeletal knights flanking him, a massive shadow passed overhead—a **white dragon** soaring away from the battle. We had no time to wonder why.

The fight was brutal. Stol fell and was restored by Rudiger. But together we chipped away at the Priest's unholy defenses, defeating his acolytes while simultaneously confronting the Fallen Priest himself.

At last, we struck him down. The portal crumbled. **Aidin was saved**—weak, but alive.

## The Legend of the Golden Bell

After the battle, Greeve—restored from his Slaad transformation—explained what he knew. The traveler who had come to Phandalin told them of an ancient legend: when barbarians repeatedly sacked Shavras, the villagers melted all their gold into a bell and covered it with copper to hide its value.

The **Bell of Shavras** still sat atop the ruined shrine—5,000 gold pieces covered in 1,000 copper pieces. Along with it, we claimed:

- **Devotee's Censer**
- **Circlet of Blasting**
- **Mace of Disruption**
- **Throwing Axe +1**

## Something Awakens Below

As we approached Aidin, the Priest's body liquified and seeped into the earth. The ground shook. Ruins collapsed. When the dust settled, a dark entrance had opened—leading into the depths of Shavras.

Aidin sat up, eyes wide: *"Something old is awakening. We must put an end to this."*

## The Dungeon Beneath

Shadows flickered on the walls, replaying the last moments of ancient priests who had sealed this place:

> *"The bloodline must remain unbroken..."*
> *"We were betrayed... the last of the faithful... slaughtered..."*
> *"If the seal fails... the world will burn..."*

We descended, fighting our way through goblin warriors, skeletal warriors, a hulking ogre, and giant spiders. Each chamber held treasures:

- **Ring of Protection**
- **Battering Shield**
- **Bag of Holding**
- **Pipes of Haunting**

We found murals depicting sacred bloodlines—Greeve noticed one crest similar to his own family's. The Priest's voice echoed: *"The portal of the Undergods will be defended at all costs!"*

## The Heart of Shavras

In the final chamber, purple light pulsed from a floating box containing a heart. The room shook violently, and a massive dark shade took the form of the Priest once more.

*"The power of the old gods is beyond your wildest dreams. Pledge to the ancients and you will wield its power."*

Four skeletal warriors rose from the ground—the actual remains of ancient buried priests. We fought desperately while Aidin chanted in the corner, Greeve shielding her with his body.

Then Greeve kissed Aidin on the back of her head, stood, and charged the wraith.

## The Guardian's Sacrifice

The Priest's bone sword impaled Greeve. *"A bastard's blood may be as thin as water, but it still carries the weight of a crown."*

Greeve slid off the blade and crumpled to the ground.

We banished the undead priest. Aidin ran to Greeve's side.

With his dying breath, Greeve spoke: *"My family never told me of their royal blood, but my death will only seal the vault until they track down all of my ancestors. Go. My fate is now tied here."*

**Greeve became a wraith—the eternal guardian of the vault of Shavras.**

The walls began to crumble. We escaped with our lives, our loot, and the knowledge that one chapter had ended.

*The Fallen Priest is destroyed. The vault of Shavras is sealed—guarded forever by Greeve's sacrifice. But what of Aidin? And what ancient evil first corrupted the Priest?*

**Arc One Complete.**

**Next Session:** A new threat emerges in Astgrove...
