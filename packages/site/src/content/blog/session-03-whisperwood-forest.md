## Into the Cursed Wood

Still reeling from Greeve's revelation, we learned that the only path to Shavras runs through **Whisperwood Forest**—a haunting place of despair and witchcraft, cursed by echoes of past atrocities. Greeve insisted we had no choice. To save Aidin, we must set aside fear.

Dain, unable to speak with his tongue torn out, wrote "Home" in blood on the mine wall. Greeve suggested he stay in Ulfandor to heal. We gave him Adabra's letter to deliver to Riglid in Phandalin.

Greeve also revealed the truth about him and Aidin: they weren't having an affair. They had denounced their religion and were practicing ancient rituals in secret. A mysterious traveler had told Aidin her surname "Trynn" might connect her to the founders of Shavras. During a summer solstice ritual, the world went cold and dark—then they awoke in chains, prisoners of the orc horde.

## The Forest That Watches

At Whisperwood's edge, an old robed man with a lantern warned us: *"Beware the shifting paths of illusion. This way to the grove of lost souls."*

The forest lived up to its reputation:
- The air grew colder with every step
- Ghostly whispers echoed around us, sometimes taking familiar voices
- Trees seemed to move when unobserved
- A layer of ground fog swirled with every footstep

## Grove of Lost Souls

In a clearing of scattered stone ruins and ancient gravestones, **six skeletal warriors** rose from the earth—tattered armor, rusted helmets, longswords drawn. Stol's Turn Undead repelled three of them, and we made quick work of the rest, though their bones exploded into damaging fragments when destroyed.

## The Ossuary

Beyond a wrought-iron gate, we found a stone structure under a blood-red moon. Inside lay thousands of bones and skulls wrapped in linen on marble slabs. As we explored, seven mummified corpses slowly rose and shuffled toward us.

Stol's holy power once again proved invaluable, repelling several zombies while we dispatched the rest. A crash of thunder and flash of lightning followed, then an evil laugh echoed through the ossuary as every candle suddenly ignited.

## The Silent Boatman

The trail led to a fog-shrouded lake. A wooden raft emerged from the mist, steered by a robed figure who spoke no words—only motioned us aboard. Floating orbs of light drifted past as we crossed the phantom water.

Exhausted, we made camp on the far shore amid the forest's maddening symphony of whispers, cackling birds, and torrential rain.

## The Night Hag's Deception

Malum found a torn piece of fabric—Aidin's dress. Greeve touched it and received a vision: Aidin running, a group chasing her. Then Aidin's voice joined the forest whispers: *"My dear Aidin, I am beyond the veil, beyond hope now. Do not come for me."*

Giant spiders emerged from the shrubs. We defeated them easily—perhaps too easily.

Then we saw her. A woman lying on the ground in a tattered dress. Greeve ran to her, crying *"Aidin!"* But when he touched her shoulder, her face contorted—revealing an elderly hag with wispy gray hair and a twisted pale face.

As Greeve levitated in agony, the **Night Hag** uttered her curse:

> *"Through roots that twist and shadows dance,*
> *You will find no second chance.*
> *Each step you take, the forest claims,*
> *Your blood, your soul, your very name.*
> *Turn back now, or face the cost—*
> *All you love shall soon be lost."*

Lightning struck. The hag vanished. Greeve crumpled to the ground. And each of us felt our wisdom drain away as a vision of the dark priest invaded our minds.

**We are cursed.**

*Cribben's fate was stranger still—the curse transformed him into a toad, and he hopped off into the forest, never to be seen again...*

**Next Session:** Can we break the Hag's curse and reach Shavras in time?
