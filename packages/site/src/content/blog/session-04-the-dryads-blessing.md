## A New Ally

Still cursed and lost in Whisperwood's eternal night, we spotted an old wooden watchtower jutting above the treeline. Inside, we found **Accoa Krigsdottir**, an Aasimar Paladin who had lost her way while scouting goblins near Kryptgarden Forest. She had taken refuge from the storm.

From the top of the watchtower, we glimpsed hope—the edge of Whisperwood gave way to sweeping plains of light-tufted grasslands awash in midday sunshine.

## Under Siege

Our relief was short-lived. Loud chanting rose from below, and we saw torches approaching—**nine cultists** bearing sickles and flames. They set the watchtower ablaze.

In the thick of battle, something miraculous happened. A massive tree fell on four cultists, killing them instantly. But the tree was *moving*—and from within it emerged the shape of a woman.

## Erinthin of the Moonwoods

After the battle calmed, the Dryad **Erinthin** communicated with us through Accoa's Speak with Animals spell:

> *"I am Erinthin, a Dryad of the Moonwoods. This evil has soured these woods for far too long. I watched as the Witch cursed your party, and I will attempt to break her wretched spell."*

True to her word, Erinthin lifted the Night Hag's curse—our wisdom was restored. She also gave us three gifts:

- **Longbow +1** with five thorn-bloom arrows that cause extra damage
- **Nature's Mantle** — a cloak that shifts color to blend with terrain
- **Three Imbued Acorns** — when planted, they sprout saplings of Erinthin's bonded tree

Her final words guided our path: *"My kin tell me you are after the Priest? He travels in shadow, between this world and soon another if he has his way. You are not far from Shavras."*

## The Night Hag's Last Stand

Leaving Whisperwood at last, we came to a bridge where a traveling merchant awaited. But as we approached, the merchant transformed—revealing the **Night Hag** once more.

*"This is not the way. Right or left, one of which will lead to death."*

She attacked, claws slashing. But this time, we were ready. **Kei** dealt the killing blow and released her **Soul Bag**, freeing the tormented spirits she had collected over centuries.

## The Shrine of Shavras

At the top of the hill beyond the bridge, an open field spread before us—and in the distance stood the ruins of the **Shrine of Shavras**. But the field was chaos.

**Dain** and his dwarf clan were locked in battle with goblins and orcs. Near the shrine itself, the Fallen Priest stood over a woman's body laid upon a stone slab—**Aidin**. Behind them, a circle of stone glowed red.

And then Greeve... transformed. His body twisted into a lizard-like creature—a **Gray Slaad**—and charged toward the shrine.

The final confrontation had begun.

*With Aidin's life hanging in the balance and the Fallen Priest attempting his dark ritual, we must fight through an army to reach the shrine. But what has become of Greeve?*

**Next Session:** The Battle of Shavras.
