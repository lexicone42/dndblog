## The Adventure Begins

Our party arrived in the frontier town of **Phandalin**, summoned by Townmaster Riglid Hoxley. The town had been plagued by raids on their supply lines, and worse—three villagers had been kidnapped, one already murdered. Rumors swirled that two of the missing, **Aidin** and **Greeve**, had been having an affair before their disappearance.

## The Party

- **Stol** — Human Cleric
- **Rudiger** — Human Rogue
- **Skid Demon** — Half-Elf Ranger
- **Kei Eaglesnout** — Human Fighter
- **Malum Munus Exemplar** — Half-Elf Rogue
- **Cribben Hayduke** — Elf Druid

## A Dwarf's Request

Our meeting with Riglid was interrupted by **Dain Hemnulim**, a dwarf warrior seeking escort to Dalvenholm. He claimed goblins and orcs had overrun the Triboar Trail and separated him from his travel party. In exchange for safe passage, he pledged his services to our cause.

## Drunk Goblins and Dark Omens

Setting out from Phandalin, we encountered a burning cart and three drunken goblins attempting to extort us for ale. After dispatching them (Dain's great axe made quick work of the captives), one goblin revealed something troubling before his demise: *"There is more to just supply raids... our master is looking for someone."*

The goblin carried a trinket—a small gold-colored bell on a chain, bearing the ancient word **"Shavras"** in worn, raised lettering.

## The Fallenore Hot Springs

We arrived at the Fallenore Hot Springs, an ancient tiered waterfall cascading down a cliff. Two thieves—enslaved women fleeing an orc horde—attempted to rob us but quickly surrendered. They mentioned the town of **Ulfandor** and a *"hidden door"* before Stol's charity sent them safely on their way.

## Rest at Gullborey

The session ended with the party purchasing potions at a small rest stop called Gullborey. A sleepy town with little to offer but an inn, tavern, and arcane shop.

But even here, the innkeeper's strange reaction to Dain gave us pause...

*What secrets does the Bell of Shavras hold? Who is the "someone" the goblins' master seeks? And what waits behind the hidden door of Ulfandor?*

**Next Session:** The road to Umbrage Hill and the mysteries of Ulfandor await.
