# Sleight of Hand

**Ability:** Dexterity

Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Sleight of Hand check. The DM might also call for a Sleight of Hand check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.
