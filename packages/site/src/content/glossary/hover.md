# Hover

Some creatures can hover, as noted in their stat blocks, and some spells and other effects grant the ability to hover. Hovering while flying prevents you from falling in certain circumstances. See also “Flying.” Illusions Spellsandothereffectssometimescreatemagicalillusions.Such an effectdefineswhattheillusiondoes andwhichsensesormentalfacultiesitdeceives. If an illusion manifests in space, the illusion is insubstantial and weightless, yet it seems to be affected by the environment as if the illusion were real unless the effect that created it specifies otherwise. For example, a visual illusion of a creature casts shadows and reflections, and wind appears to affect the illusory creature. Similarly, an audible illusion echoes in an echoey space.
