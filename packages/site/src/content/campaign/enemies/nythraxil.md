# Nythraxil

An ancient rose quartz dragon, so old that his body had fused with the stone of Stonehell Isle. Keeper of the ley stone and font of ancient knowledge.

## The Dragon's Lair

To enter Nythraxil's chamber, visitors had to release their memories into crystal pools. The party shared their experiences, and the dragon judged them worthy.

## Description

Rose quartz formations grew from Nythraxil's scales, fused with his ancient body. The ley stone itself had become part of him—extracted only when he chose to give it.

## The Prophecy

Before his death, Nythraxil directed the party toward their next steps:
- Seek the Jundites of Eberron
- Find the word of Ildrar, cleric of Orondin
- The Key of Agmon may be needed

## Death

The Circle Mage arrived at the worst moment. His ice blast severed Nythraxil's wing—an injury even the ancient dragon could not survive. With his last breath, Nythraxil breathed fire at his attacker, then died.

Rudiger secured the ley stone. The dragon's sacrifice was not in vain.
