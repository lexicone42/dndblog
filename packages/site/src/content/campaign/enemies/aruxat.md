# Aru'xat the Verdant Maw

An ancient primordial entity of unimaginable power. Also called "Feeder of Forests," Aru'xat once devoured entire worlds before being sealed during the Dawn Wars.

## Origin

When the gods first planted life in the cosmos, beings like Aru'xat threatened to consume it all. The Dawn Wars saw these primordials sealed away—but their prisons require maintenance.

## The Threat

The Slanted Circle's plan:
1. Construct the Maw Frame (Throat of Aru'xat)
2. Align the world's ley lines using the resonance engine
3. Create vibrations that match Aru'xat's frequency
4. Shatter the seals and awaken the Verdant Maw

## Skid's Vision

Skid Demon received a prophetic vision of what Aru'xat's awakening would mean: fire, decay, and the rise of something ancient and hungry. The world consumed. Life unmade.

## Current Status

Sealed—but threatened. Each ley anchor that falls brings Aru'xat closer to waking. The party's mission to stabilize the anchors is all that stands between the world and annihilation.
