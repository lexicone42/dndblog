# The Circle Mage

A terrifyingly powerful wizard and the Slanted Circle's primary field operative. Despite multiple encounters, the Circle Mage has escaped every confrontation.

## Description

Tattered robes bearing a burned sigil. Eyes that glow with ley reflection. Power enough to match an ancient dragon.

## Encounters

### 1. The Kraken Attack
During the sea journey to Stonehell Isle, the Circle Mage was spotted observing Captain Tallow. When the kraken attacked the pirate ship, he dove into the water and escaped.

### 2. Stonehell Isle
Arrived at Nythraxil's lair and killed the ancient rose quartz dragon with an ice blast that severed its wing. Fell down the mountain during the combat but survived.

### 3. Heart Stone Chamber
Appeared when the anchor core opened beneath Sharn. Vanished mysteriously, leaving his sigil burned into the floor—a warning that this is not over.

## Threat Level

The Circle Mage has proven himself capable of:
- Killing an ancient dragon
- Surviving impossible falls
- Evading capture repeatedly
- Using magic the party has not yet countered

His presence at the Heart Stone Chamber suggests the Slanted Circle knew about the anchor before the party did.
