# Cultist Blademancer

Standing just over six feet tall, the Cultist Blademancer is clad in polished half-plate etched with slanted rune glyphs that pulse faintly when it moves. Its gauntleted hands grip a pair of slender, rune-etched longswords that shimmer with contained arcane energy. A tattered black cloak flutters behind it, and its eyes glow with a cold, violet light as it surveys its foes with predatory calm.

## Lore

The Cultist Blademancer is a warrior of The Slanted Circle, an esoteric cult that fuses martial prowess and arcane sorcery. Trained from childhood in deadly sword forms and ritual blade-magic, these cultists are dispatched to eliminate rivals and enforce the will of their shadowed council. Each Blademancer seeks ever greater mastery of forbidden runes etched into their weapons, hoping to claim arcane power that borders on divinity.

## Session 11 Encounter

Two Blademancers ambushed the party in the Xen'Drik jungle. Their teleporting Blade Dance ability made them difficult to pin down, and their coordinated attacks with the Cultist Mages created deadly crossfire situations. Accoa took significant damage from their focused assault.
