# Veyra

A changeling spy who posed as the party's contact while secretly feeding their every movement to the Slanted Circle.

## Infiltration

Veyra was a master of deception:
- First appeared as a serving girl
- Later posed as a rail agent
- Fed all party movements to the Circle
- Her true form was only revealed at Tavick's Landing

## Final Words

"Did you truly think I was your ally? Every step, every whisper—I fed to the Circle."

## Defeat

Veyra was killed during the Lightning Rail battle at Tavick's Landing when her treachery was finally exposed alongside Harlix Darkleaf.
