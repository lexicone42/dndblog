# General Varkuun

The last warlord of the Dhakaani Empire, bound by duty to guard the Heart Stone anchor for eternity.

## Description

Encased in ley-crystal armor that pulsed with the same light as the anchor. Eyes burning blue with ancient power. Even in undeath, he maintained the bearing of a supreme commander.

## The Final Battle

When the party entered the Heart Stone Chamber, a voice spoke from the skulls: "The Heart endures. Who commands the stone?"

General Varkuun rose to test them—the final guardian of an empire that fell millennia ago.

## Final Words

"You are the last commanders. Guard what we could not."

In defeat, Varkuun passed the mantle of protection to the party. The statues of hobgoblin generals bowed and released motes of light as the anchor stabilized.
