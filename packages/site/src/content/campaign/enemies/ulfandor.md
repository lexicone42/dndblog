# Ulfandor

A white dragon spotted flying during the final battle with the Fallen Priest at Shavras shrine. The dragon's appearance and departure remain unexplained.

## The Sighting

As the Fallen Priest fell for the first time and his body liquified into the earth, a white dragon was seen circling high above the shrine. It did not engage in battle, merely observed, then flew away.

## Mystery

Why was Ulfandor there? Was he watching the Fallen Priest, the party, or the portal ritual? His connection to events at Shavras remains unknown—a thread yet to be pulled.
