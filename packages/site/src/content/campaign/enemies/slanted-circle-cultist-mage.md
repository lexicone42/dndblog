# Slanted Circle Cultist Mage

Tall and gaunt, the Slanted Circle Cultist Mage wears charcoal-black robes embroidered with off-kilter glyphs. Her pale skin is stretched tight over sharp cheekbones, and her eyes glow with a sickly amber light whenever she weaves arcane power. She clutches a dagger in one hand and a battered spellbook in the other, muttering incantations in a tongue that grates on the ear.

## Lore

Once a promising scholar of arcane symbols, the Cultist Mage was lured into the heretical teachings of a hidden cabal known as The Slanted Circle. Obsessed with tearing open portals to other realms and summoning forces beyond mortal comprehension, she now serves the Circle's shadowy aims: to unravel reality's fabric.
