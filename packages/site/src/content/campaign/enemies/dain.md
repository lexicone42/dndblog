# Dain

A former companion of the party who revealed his true allegiance when he led them into a deadly ambush at Umbrage Hill.

At Umbrage Hill, Dain triggered a hidden door that sprang a trap on the party. The ambush was their first encounter with the forces of the Fallen Priest—and the revelation that one of their own had been working against them.

## Fate Unknown

Dain escaped during the chaos of the ambush. His current whereabouts and fate are unknown, but his betrayal remains a bitter memory for the party.
