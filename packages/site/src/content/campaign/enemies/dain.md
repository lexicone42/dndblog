# Dain

A former companion of the party who was coerced into leading them into an ambush at Umbrage Hill. Though his actions appeared to be betrayal, Dain was a victim of blackmail by the forces of the Fallen Priest.

## The Ambush

At Umbrage Hill, Dain triggered a hidden door that sprang a trap on the party. The ambush was their first encounter with the forces of the Fallen Priest. What seemed like treachery was later revealed to be the desperate act of a man with no other choice.

## A Pawn, Not a Traitor

Evidence uncovered suggests Dain was being blackmailed—forced to cooperate with the Fallen Priest's agents under threat of harm to himself or others he cared about. His "betrayal" was not born of malice but of coercion.

## The Price of Silence

His tongue was [taken by his captors](/tongue), silencing whatever secrets he might have revealed about his handlers or their plans.

## Fate Unknown

Dain's current whereabouts are unknown. Whether he escaped, was disposed of by his blackmailers, or remains a prisoner somewhere, the party may never know. But the truth of his circumstances has tempered their anger with sympathy.
