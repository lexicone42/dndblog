# Ley-Charged Direwolf

A hulking lupine creature whose grizzled fur crackles with faint arcs of pale blue energy. Pulsing runes glow along its flanks, and its eyes burn like twin sapphires. When it moves, the air around its paws shimmers as if the world itself is briefly caught on the brink of arcane upheaval.

## Lore

Legends say that deep within ancient forests, where ley lines intersect beneath moonlit groves, dire wolves have been touched by arcane power. The Ley-Charged Direwolf hunts at these crossroads of magic, driven by a restless hunger for raw ley energy. It claims territory around these nodal points, tearing at twisted roots and stone to feed on raw magical currents.

Though chaotic in temperament, it will defend its chosen haunt against anyone who would tap its precious ley lines.
