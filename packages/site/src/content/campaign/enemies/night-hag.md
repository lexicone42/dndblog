# Night Hag

A malevolent hag who cursed Whisperwood Forest and preyed on travelers for years.

## Methods

The Night Hag drained her victims slowly in their sleep, keeping them weak but alive. She took special interest in collecting living trophies, including Accoa as a child.

## Riddles and Portents

Before her defeat, the hag spoke in riddles about "paths leading to death" — prophecies that would prove grimly accurate as the party's journey continued.

## Defeat

The party tracked the hag to her lair deep in Whisperwood Forest. With Accoa's help, they ended her reign of terror, lifting the curse that had darkened the forest.

## Legacy

- Whisperwood Forest began healing after her death
- Dryad Erinthin's power returned
- Accoa was finally freed from her captor
- The party gained the Dryad's blessing
