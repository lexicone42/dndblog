# Captain Tallow

Captain of the Siren's Song and the airship Stormlight. Tallow appears to be a simple ship captain, but is secretly a druid of Eberron with significant magical power.

## Secret Identity

Behind the weathered sailor facade, Tallow wields druidic magic:
- **Banishment**: When a kraken threatened the ship during the pirate attack, Tallow banished it—an incredibly powerful feat
- **Mist-Parting Ritual**: Performed the ritual that allowed passage through Stonehell Isle's protective enchanted mist

## The Journey to Stonehell

Tallow transported the party to Stonehell Isle, navigating the treacherous waters and performing the ancient ritual needed to pierce the island's magical concealment.

## The Circle Mage Encounter

During the kraken attack, Tallow noticed the Circle mage observing him. The mage dove into the water and escaped rather than engaging—suggesting even he recognized Tallow's power.

## The Stormlight

Tallow's airship, a marvel of Khorvairian engineering powered by a bound air elemental. The Stormlight carried the party from Sharn to Xen'Drik in Session 11.

> *"Now there's a sorry sight for sore eyes... I heard you lot have been giving Sharn hell."*

During the journey, the Stormlight was ambushed by a Slanted Circle airship. Tallow piloted the ship through the aerial battle while the party fought off the attackers, ultimately capturing the enemy vessel.

> *"That land doesn't forget trespassers. Prepare for landing at Stormreach."*
