# Captain Tallow

Captain of the Siren's Song, stationed at Muck Bay. Tallow appears to be a simple ship captain, but is secretly a druid of Eberron with significant magical power.

## Secret Identity

Behind the weathered sailor facade, Tallow wields druidic magic:
- **Banishment**: When a kraken threatened the ship during the pirate attack, Tallow banished it—an incredibly powerful feat
- **Mist-Parting Ritual**: Performed the ritual that allowed passage through Stonehell Isle's protective enchanted mist

## The Journey to Stonehell

Tallow transported the party to Stonehell Isle, navigating the treacherous waters and performing the ancient ritual needed to pierce the island's magical concealment.

## The Circle Mage Encounter

During the kraken attack, Tallow noticed the Circle mage observing him. The mage dove into the water and escaped rather than engaging—suggesting even he recognized Tallow's power.
