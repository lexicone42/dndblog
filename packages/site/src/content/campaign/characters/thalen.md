# Thalen

An ancient druid who lived centuries ago, Thalen bound himself to the leylines beneath Sharn in an act of ultimate sacrifice. When he died, his essence merged with the water table, creating what is now known as **Thalen's Well**.

## The Legend

As Rook Targrave explained to the party:

*"Centuries ago, a druid named Thalen bound himself to the leylines beneath this city. When he died, his essence merged with the water table. The spring you see before you is connected to those same currents you just stabilized."*

## Thalen's Well

Located within Verdant Hollow, the hidden Emerald Enclave grove in Sharn, Thalen's Well is a pool of perfectly still water surrounded by a stone circle. The water is connected to the ley network the party stabilized.

Those who drink from the Well receive a portion of Thalen's vitality—a rare gift the Enclave offers only to those who have proven themselves worthy.

> *The Well remembers. The Well strengthens. What was given shall not be taken.*

## Legacy

Though Thalen died long ago, his sacrifice continues to benefit those who serve the natural order. The party drank from his Well after stabilizing the Heart Stone, and each felt something ancient settle into their bones—stronger, more whole, connected to the leylines in a way they hadn't been before.
