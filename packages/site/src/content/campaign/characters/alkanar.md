# Alkanar

An elderly dragonborn who serves as a historian for the Emerald Enclave. Alkanar's vast knowledge of Eberron and its history proved invaluable in preparing the party for their mission.

## The Briefing

Before the party traveled to Sharn, Alkanar provided crucial historical context:
- The structure and politics of Sharn, the City of Towers
- The Dhakaani Empire's legacy beneath the city
- The importance of Eberron in the network of ley anchors

## Wisdom of Ages

Though old and no longer a field operative, Alkanar's knowledge spans centuries of Enclave records. His understanding of planar connections and ancient civilizations makes him an irreplaceable resource.
