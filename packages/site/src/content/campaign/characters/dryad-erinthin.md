# Dryad Erinthin

Ancient guardian of the Whisperwood Forest heart. Erinthin blessed the party after they defeated the Night Hag and lifted the curse from her domain.

## The Forest Heart

Erinthin dwells in the sacred grove at Whisperwood's heart. The Night Hag's curse had weakened her influence, but with the hag defeated, her power is returning.

## Gifts and Blessings

- Blessed the entire party with the forest's favor
- Gave Skid the Dryad's bow, a mark of trust and alliance
- Recognized Accoa as a former captive of the hag, welcoming her home

## Connection to the Emerald Enclave

Harlix Darkleaf immediately recognized the Dryad's bow, using it as proof that the party was allied with the forest guardians and, by extension, the Emerald Enclave.
