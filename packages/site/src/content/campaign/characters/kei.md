### Session 8 - Cornerstone Tavern

### Session 9 - Vision in the Dhakaani Ruins

## Combat Role

As the party's frontline damage dealer and tank, Kei excels at sustained melee combat. With Extra Attack and high Strength, he can reliably put out consistent damage every turn. The Champion's Improved Critical gives him a 10% chance of devastating critical hits, and his Topple mastery allows battlefield control by knocking enemies Prone for the party to capitalize on.
