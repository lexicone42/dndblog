# Elder Elarion Mossbark

Leader of Verdant Hollow, the hidden Emerald Enclave chapter house in Sharn. Elder Mossbark oversees the Enclave's operations in the City of Towers.

## Verdant Hollow

Located in a hollowed tower garden, Verdant Hollow serves as a sanctuary for Enclave members in Sharn. Elder Mossbark maintains the chapter despite internal suspicion about traitors in their ranks.

## Warnings

When the party arrived, Elder Mossbark warned them:
- Harlix Darkleaf was being tracked by unknown forces
- The ley shard the party carried made them easier to track
- Their Black Mantle identities were intentionally compromised to lure enemies

## The Divided Enclave

Elder Mossbark carries the burden of knowing the Enclave has been infiltrated. His warnings to the party came just in time—Harlix's betrayal proved his suspicions correct.
