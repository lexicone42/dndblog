# Harlix Darkleaf

Once a trusted member of The Knock and initial contact for the party, Harlix was revealed in Sharn as a traitor working for the Slanted Circle.

## The Betrayal

The party first met Harlix at The Mason and the Chain in Astgrove. He was the one who brought them to witness the Maw Frame and seemed like a valuable ally, devastating in combat alongside Rudiger.

But in Sharn, his true nature emerged:
- Sold the stolen druidic cipher book to a "scarred mage" in the black market
- Fed party movements to the Slanted Circle
- Revealed the location of the Eberron ley anchor in the Dhakaani dungeons

## Confession

"The Enclave is fractured. The Circle will bring order—a new balance. You're just too blind to see it."

## Current Status

Captured by the party and handed over to Master Molrik and the dwarven clan for custody, along with the recovered Dragonshards.
