# Master Molrik

Leader of the Molrik clan, the dwarven community that dwells beneath Sharn near the ancient Dhakaani ruins.

## The Meeting

When the party arrived in the deep passages beneath Sharn, the Molrik clan sensed the ley flux they carried. Master Molrik personally led them to the entrance of the Dhakaani ruins after Glun, one of his clan, recognized Skid as "Stone-born."

## Rewards and Honor

After the party stabilized the Heart Stone anchor, Master Molrik:
- Rewarded them with magical items from the clan's forge
- Granted them "eternal respect" of the Molrik clan
- Took custody of Harlix Darkleaf for dwarven justice
- Accepted the captured Dragonshards for safekeeping

## The Forward Camp

The Molrik clan maintains an ancient forward camp near the Dhakaani ruins, lit by magma streams flowing through dwarven forges. It serves as the last outpost before the goblinoid depths.
