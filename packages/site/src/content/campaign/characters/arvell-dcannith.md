# Arvell d'Cannith

A dragonmarked artificer of House Cannith, Arvell leads the research team developing technology to stabilize Sharn's ley network.

## The Regulator Project

Arvell has been working on a device called "the regulator"—an artificer's solution to the magical instability caused by the growing Ley Maw. The device would stabilize the entire ley network, not just individual anchors.

## The Briefing

From his office in Skyway Hall Suite 47, Arvell explained the dire situation to the party:

*"You've stabilized the primary anchor, yes. But the system is damaged. The rift—what our scholars call the Ley Maw—continues to grow."*

He revealed that the Dragonshards the party had recovered were key components for the regulator. Without them, the device could not function.

## The Attack

During the briefing, Slanted Circle agents burst through the windows on hang gliders, stealing the regulator schematics and backup copies from Arvell's vault. The theft left him shaken—without those plans, House Cannith cannot build the device that might save Sharn.

## Current Status

Arvell now works to reconstruct what was lost, but time is not on his side. The Ley Maw grows, and the Circle has everything they need to potentially weaponize his research.
