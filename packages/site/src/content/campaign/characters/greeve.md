# Greeve

A tragic hero who unknowingly carried royal blood, Greeve made the ultimate sacrifice to seal the Shavras Vault.

## Background

- Originally from Phandalin
- Had royal blood (unbeknownst to him)
- Connected to the bloodline murals discovered in Shavras

## Transformation

Greeve was transformed into a Slaad at some point, then restored by the party. This experience marked him deeply.

## The Sacrifice

During the final battle with the Fallen Priest, Greeve was impaled by the Priest's bone sword. In his dying moments, he chose to become a wraith guardian, sealing the vault with his sacrifice.

### Final Words
> "My family never told me of their royal blood, but my death will only seal the vault until they track down all of my ancestors."

## Current Status

Greeve now exists as an eternal guardian of the Shavras Vault. The vault remains sealed, its treasures and secrets protected by his spectral form.
