# Lux

A halfling woman with silver-streaked hair and eyes that see too much. Lux runs **The Floating Trinket**, a shop in Sharn's Sky Market that appears wherever it needs to be.

## Appearance

Short even for a halfling, Lux carries herself with the quiet confidence of someone who has seen much and judged little. Her silver-streaked dark hair frames a face lined with laugh lines and old sorrows.

## The Floating Trinket

Her shop is legendary among those who know to look for it—a structure that seems to exist in multiple places at once, or perhaps no place at all. Those who truly need something tend to find its door.

## The Gift

When the party arrived at the Sky Market, Lux found them before they found her. She presented them with **The Heart of the Wild**, a legendary Dragonshard that the Emerald Enclave had been holding for whoever would next stabilize the ley anchors.

*"I've been holding this for someone. Turns out that someone is you."*

## Role

Lux serves as one of the Emerald Enclave's agents in Sharn's upper districts, using her shop's unique nature to pass messages and objects between those who need them.
