# Rook Targrave

A stern and perceptive member of the Emerald Enclave's High Council. Rook briefed the party on the true nature of their enemy.

## The Briefing

Rook Targrave revealed crucial information to the party:
- The identity and nature of Aru'xat, the Verdant Maw
- The Slanted Circle's plan to awaken the primordial
- The importance of the ley anchors across multiple planes

## Perception

Blunt and direct, Rook sees through pretense. He sensed Rudiger's internal conflict—the wizard's struggle with something deep and unspoken—and gave him the Scroll of Lightning Resistance as both gift and message: some storms you must weather alone.

## Role

As High Council member, Rook helps coordinate the Emerald Enclave's efforts to stop the Slanted Circle across multiple planes.
