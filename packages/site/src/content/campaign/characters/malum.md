# Malum Munus Exemplar

Known simply as "Mal" to companions, Malum is a Half-Elf Rogue who walks the path of the Assassin. Quick with a blade and quicker with wit, Mal serves as the party's eyes in the shadows.

## Background

Little is known of Mal's past before joining the party. The name "Malum Munus Exemplar" suggests a dark gift or purpose, though Mal rarely speaks of such matters.

## Notable Actions

### The Ulfandor Mines
When Dain was left behind after having his tongue torn out by the Fallen Priest, Mal gave him the letter from Adabra Gwynn to deliver to Riglid, the Townmaster of Phandalin.

### The Whisperwood
While making camp in the haunted forest, Mal's keen eyes discovered a torn piece of fabric from a dress - a vital clue that led Greeve to have a vision of Aidin in danger.

## Combat Role

As an Assassin, Mal excels at striking from the shadows and eliminating targets before they can react. The party relies on Mal for reconnaissance, trap detection, and delivering devastating first strikes in combat.
