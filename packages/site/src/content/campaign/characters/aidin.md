# Aidin

A captive rescued from the Fallen Priest's clutches, Aidin was being used for the portal ritual to the Undergods.

## Rescue

The party found Aidin weak but alive after the vault events. She was being drained as part of the Fallen Priest's dark ritual to open a portal to the Undergods.

## Connection to Greeve

Greeve and Aidin had grown close during their captivity. Before his final charge against the Fallen Priest, Greeve kissed her goodbye. His sacrifice sealed the vault—and her freedom.

## Potential

Though weakened from her ordeal, Aidin shows signs of clerical potential. Her survival may yet serve a greater purpose.
