# Skid Demon

Party member with a unique and growing connection to the world's ley energy. Carries the Dryad's bow gifted by Erinthin.

## The Ley Mark

After falling through a ley gate crack and seeing "rivers of light leading to a heart of stone," Skid developed a ley mark that glows faintly. This mark grants him abilities:

- Can sense nearby ley currents
- Heartbeat syncs with ley pulses
- Acts as a "living compass" to ley energy

The dwarven explorer Glun recognized this mark and called Skid "Stone-born" - a rare individual touched by the deep magic of the world.

## Key Moments

### The Ley Gate Vision
Fell through a crack in a ley gate, witnessing rivers of light leading to a heart of stone - a prophetic vision of what awaited in Eberron.

### Recognition by the Dwarves
The Molrik clan's Glun immediately recognized Skid as "Stone-born," treating him with a respect usually reserved for ancient beings.

### Prophetic Visions
Had visions of world destruction if the ley anchors break - fire, decay, and the rise of something ancient and hungry.

### The Heart Stone Chamber
His ley connection intensified after the vision in the Heart Stone Chamber, where his presence helped stabilize the Eberron anchor.
