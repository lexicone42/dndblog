### Session 7 - Nythraxil's Lair
Successfully secured the ley stone from Nythraxil's lair after the ancient rose quartz dragon's death, a critical victory for the party.

### Session 8 - Lightning Rail Battle
Rudiger's Fireball proved particularly devastating during the combat aboard the Lightning Rail, igniting the sleeping Circle agents' car and eliminating all but one.

### Session 8 - Sharn Chase

## Combat Role

As the party's primary arcane damage dealer, Rudiger excels at eliminating groups of enemies with area-effect spells. His Evoker specialization allows him to position Fireballs without endangering allies. The high Intelligence (+4) gives him exceptional Arcana and Investigation skills, making him valuable for identifying magical threats and solving puzzles.
