## Origin

Accoa was kidnapped by the Night Hag when young and held captive in Whisperwood Forest for years. The hag drained victims slowly in their sleep, keeping Accoa weak but alive for some unknown purpose. Her celestial heritage as a Protector Aasimar may have been what the hag sought.

## Key Moments

### Freedom from the Night Hag
Helped the party defeat her captor, finally ending years of torment.

### Blessed by Erinthin
The Dryad of the Forest Heart recognized Accoa and blessed her with the forest's protection, which aligned with her Oath of Ancients.

### The Sharn Pursuit
Stunned the pickpocket runner in Sharn's streets, proving her worth as a capable party member.

## Combat Role

As a Paladin with the Oath of Ancients, Accoa serves as both a frontline defender and healer. Her Channel Divinity: Nature's Wrath provides battlefield control, while her Aasimar heritage grants resistance to both necrotic and radiant damage—making her particularly effective against undead and celestial threats alike.
