# Accoa

Centaur scout who was taken from Whisperwood Forest by the Night Hag as a child. Freed by the party and now travels with them as a valued companion.

## Origin

Accoa was kidnapped by the Night Hag when young and held captive in Whisperwood Forest for years. The hag drained victims slowly in their sleep, keeping Accoa weak but alive for some unknown purpose.

## Key Moments

### Freedom from the Night Hag

### Blessed by Erinthin
The Dryad of the Forest Heart recognized Accoa and blessed her with the forest's protection.

### The Sharn Pursuit
Stunned the pickpocket runner in Sharn's streets, proving her worth as a quick and capable party member.
