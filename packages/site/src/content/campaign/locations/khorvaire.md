# Khorvaire

The primary continent of the world of Eberron, Khorvaire is a land shaped by magic, war, and the power of the dragonmarked houses.

## The Five Nations

Once united under the Kingdom of Galifar, Khorvaire's central nations spent a century tearing themselves apart in the Last War:

- **Aundair** — Known for arcane education and the Floating Towers of Arcanix
- **Breland** — Industrial heart of the continent, home to Sharn
- **Cyre** — Now the Mournland, destroyed in the Day of Mourning
- **Karrnath** — Martial nation that employed undead soldiers
- **Thrane** — Theocratic nation devoted to the Silver Flame

## The Dragonmarked Houses

Thirteen (once twelve) dragonmarked houses control much of Khorvaire's commerce and industry. Each house bears a hereditary magical mark granting unique abilities:

- **House Cannith** — Mark of Making (artifice, manufacturing)
- **House Jorasco** — Mark of Healing
- **House Ghallanda** — Mark of Hospitality
- **House Orien** — Mark of Passage (transportation)
- **House Sivis** — Mark of Scribing (communication)
- And others...

## Geography

Beyond the Five Nations, Khorvaire includes:

- **The Eldeen Reaches** — Western wilderness, home to druids
- **The Mror Holds** — Dwarven mountain kingdoms
- **Zilargo** — Gnome nation known for espionage and glasswork
- **Darguun** — Goblinoid nation formed after the Last War
- **Q'barra** — Frontier land with dragonborn settlements
- **The Lhazaar Principalities** — Eastern pirate kingdoms
- **The Shadow Marches** — Swampland home to orcs and half-orcs
- **Droaam** — Nation of monsters

## Current Events

The Treaty of Thronehold ended the Last War, but peace is fragile. The Day of Mourning—which destroyed Cyre entirely—remains unexplained. Tensions simmer. And beneath it all, the leylines that connect Eberron pulse with energy that some seek to control.

The party's actions in Sharn may have consequences that ripple across the entire continent.
