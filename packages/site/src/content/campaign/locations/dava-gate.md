# Dava Gate

The largest airship terminal in Sharn, Dava Gate serves as the city's primary hub for aerial transportation to destinations across Khorvaire and beyond. Its multiple platforms and terminals handle everything from commercial passenger vessels to private charters.

## Layout

The terminal is organized into numbered terminuses, each capable of docking multiple airships:

- **Terminus 1-2**: Commercial passenger routes to major Khorvairian cities
- **Terminus 3**: Charter and private vessels (where the Stormlight was docked)
- **Terminus 4-5**: Cargo and freight operations
- **Terminus 6**: Lyrandar House exclusive berths

## Atmosphere

Dava Gate buzzes with constant activity—merchants hawking travel supplies, passengers checking manifests, dock workers loading cargo, and the ever-present hum of bound elementals powering the vessels. The smell of ozone from lightning rails mingles with the cleaner air currents that drift down from the upper platforms.

## Session 11

The party departed from Terminus 3 aboard Captain Tallow's airship, the Stormlight, bound for Xen'Drik. Rook had arranged their travel papers through the Emerald Enclave.

## Notable Features

- **Observation Deck**: Offers views of arriving and departing airships
- **Customs Office**: All international departures must clear customs
- **The Windfall Tavern**: A popular establishment for travelers awaiting their vessels
