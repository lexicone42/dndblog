# Stormreach

The primary port city of Xen'Drik, Stormreach is chaos incarnate—a frontier settlement where law is suggestion and everyone has secrets.

## Description

The docks buzz with activity from travelers, merchants, and those seeking fortune or escape in the dangerous continent. Unlike the ordered towers of Sharn, Stormreach sprawls organically, a rough settlement at the edge of civilization.

## The Circle Trail

The party arrived at Stormreach in Session 11, seeking the Slanted Circle expedition that had passed through earlier. Dockworkers reported:

> *"They came through earlier, hired guides to take them through the jungle. Headed inland within the hour, about eight folks. They had crates and some pack dogs with them."*

The Circle had an hour's head start into the jungle.

## Gateway to the Interior

Stormreach serves as the staging point for expeditions into Xen'Drik's dangerous interior. Guides can be hired here, though their reliability varies. The party used Accoa and Stol's tracking abilities to follow the Circle's trail from here.
