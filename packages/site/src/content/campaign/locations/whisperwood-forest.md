# Whisperwood Forest

A dark, twisted forest that was cursed by the Night Hag for years. Undead patrols wandered its paths, and unnatural fog obscured the way.

## The Curse

The Night Hag's influence:
- Twisted the trees
- Summoned undead patrols
- Created disorienting fog
- Weakened Dryad Erinthin's power

## Liberation

After the party defeated the Night Hag, the curse began to lift:
- Dryad Erinthin's power returned
- The forest heart became safe again
- Accoa was freed from her captor
- Party received the Dryad's blessing
