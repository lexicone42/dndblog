# Verdant Hollow

A hidden grove nestled impossibly between Sharn's stone towers, Verdant Hollow serves as the Emerald Enclave's chapter house in the City of Towers. Ancient trees grow from floating platforms of earth, their roots drinking from streams that fall upward.

## Description

The hollow is concealed within a hollowed tower garden, invisible to those who don't know where to look. The space defies the vertical architecture of Sharn—a pocket of wild nature amid steel and stone.

- Ancient trees on floating earth platforms
- Streams that flow upward
- Stone circle at the center surrounding Thalen's Well
- Natural sanctuary warded against intrusion

## Thalen's Well

At the heart of Verdant Hollow stands a stone circle surrounding a pool of perfectly still water. Centuries ago, a druid named Thalen bound himself to the leylines beneath Sharn. When he died, his essence merged with the water table, and this spring connects to those same currents.

The Enclave offers this gift rarely. Those who drink from Thalen's Well receive a portion of his vitality—a permanent blessing of increased vitality (+5 max HP).

> *The Well remembers. The Well strengthens. What was given shall not be taken.*

## Leadership

Elder Elarion Mossbark leads Verdant Hollow, maintaining the chapter despite internal suspicion about traitors in their ranks following the Slanted Circle's infiltration attempts.

## History with the Party

- **Session 8**: The party fled here after their Black Mantle cover was blown in Callestan. The druids were divided—half believed the party had planted forged druidic notes, half feared a traitor within.
- **Session 10**: Rook brought the party here after they stabilized the Dhakaani ley anchor. The Enclave honored them with the rare gift of Thalen's Well.
