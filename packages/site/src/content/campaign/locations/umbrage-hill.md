# Umbrage Hill

A ruined area on the road from Phandalin, Umbrage Hill became the site of Dain's betrayal and the party's first encounter with the Fallen Priest's forces.

## The Betrayal

Dain led the party here under the pretense of investigation, then triggered a hidden door that sprang an ambush. The ensuing battle was their first taste of the darkness they would come to fight.
