# Stonehell Isle

A hidden island concealed by enchanted mist. Only those who know the ancient rituals can pierce the magical barrier.

## Protection

The mist surrounding Stonehell Isle:
- Conceals the island from all approaches
- Requires Captain Tallow's mist-parting ritual to penetrate
- Has protected the island for ages

## Features

- Massive stone spires rising from the sea
- Giant vultures nesting on the cliffs
- Nythraxil's lair at the summit
- Crystal pools that read memories

## Nythraxil's Lair

The ancient rose quartz dragon made his home at the island's summit. To enter, visitors had to release their memories into the crystal pools. The ley stone was here, fused to the dragon's ancient body.

## Current Status

Partially destroyed when the Circle Mage attacked. Nythraxil is dead, but the island remains.
