# The Astralglades

Ancient forest north of Astgrove, now corrupted by Slanted Circle activity. The ley lines here are visible as glowing blue energy, and strange phenomena occur: rocks rolling uphill, gravity anomalies, spatial distortions.

## The Corruption

The Slanted Circle has been:
- Cutting down ancient trees
- Forcing enslaved humans to work
- Constructing the massive Maw Frame
- Disrupting the natural ley flow

## The Maw Frame

A massive wooden jaw-like structure under construction in the north woods. Also called the "Throat of Aru'xat," it's a resonance engine designed to awaken the primordial serpent.

## The Ley Stone

The ley stone obtained from Nythraxil was given to the Emerald Enclave specifically to anchor the Astralglades' ley lines and prevent further corruption.
