# Dhakaani Ruins

The remains of an ancient goblinoid civilization, deep beneath the City of Towers. The strongest ley energy the party has ever felt pulses through these corridors.

## Chambers

### Hall of Warriors
- Statues of hobgoblin warriors with inscriptions
- "Hold the line." "The war is eternal." "Guard the heart."
- Time echoes showed ghostly soldiers from the ancient war
- Each party member experienced different visions

### Hall of Seals
- Rune-trapped tiles with force-field blades
- Required deciphering the correct path

### War Scholars' Quarters
- Three Dhakaani Wraith-Tacticians
- Death whisper: "The heart below must never fall..."

### Gauntlet of Stone & Shadow
- Six undead hobgoblin warriors
- Two Stonebound Guardians
- Shadow Captain (dropped command token)

### Heart Stone Chamber
- Cathedral-like final chamber
- Black obsidian monolith (the anchor)
- Twelve statues of hobgoblin generals
- Ley conduits flowing into walls
- General Varkuun's final stand

## The Anchor

The Heart Stone—a black obsidian monolith veined with pulsing light—serves as the ley anchor for Eberron. Skid's heartbeat synchronized with its pulses when they entered.
