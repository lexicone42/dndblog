# Shrine of Shavras

An ancient ruined shrine once belonging to a village repeatedly sacked by barbarians. The villagers melted their gold into a bell and covered it with copper to hide its value—creating the Bell of Shavras.

## The Bell

The legendary Bell of Shavras sat atop the ruined shrine:
- 5,000gp worth of gold
- Covered in 1,000cp worth of copper
- Object of legend that drew the party here

## The Battle

The Fallen Priest made his base here, preparing a portal ritual to the Undergods. The party interrupted the ritual and destroyed him—but his body liquified into the earth, opening the way to the vault below.

## The Dragon

During the battle, the white dragon Ulfandor was spotted flying overhead. He observed but did not engage, then departed—his purpose unknown.
