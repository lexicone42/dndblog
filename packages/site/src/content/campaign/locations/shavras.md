# Shavras

An ancient temple complex that once stood as a prosperous village before being repeatedly sacked by barbarians. The villagers famously melted all their gold into a bell and covered it with copper to hide its value—creating the legendary Bell of Shavras.

## History

### The Ancient Temple
In ancient times, Shavras was a thriving religious community. The temple served as a place of worship and housed a sacred bloodline that would later become the target of dark forces.

### The Barbarian Raids
After years of devastating barbarian attacks, the villagers devised a desperate plan. They melted all their gold, cast it into a bell, and covered it with copper to disguise its true value. The bell still sat atop the ruined shrine when the party arrived.

### The Fall
The temple eventually fell into ruin. The Fallen Priest and his cult discovered the ancient secrets buried beneath and began working to open a portal to the Undergods using the blood of the last descendants.

## The Bloodline of Shavras

Two important figures carry the bloodline of Shavras:
- **Aidin Trynn** — The last known descendant of the temple founders. Her sacrifice was needed to open the portal.
- **Greeve** — Unknowingly carried royal blood connected to Shavras. His death sealed the vault.

## Current State

The surface ruins of Shavras are now largely collapsed. After the defeat of the Fallen Priest and Greeve's sacrifice, an entrance to the vault beneath opened briefly before being sealed by Greeve's transformation into a wraith guardian.

## The Bell of Shavras

The legendary bell, worth 5,000gp in gold beneath its copper shell, was recovered by the party. Its ancient word "Shavras" in worn, raised lettering served as a key to unlock the hidden door in the Ulfandor mines.

## Key Events

### Session 4 - The Battle at Shavras
The party arrived to find a battle between Dain's dwarf clan and goblins/orcs. The Fallen Priest stood over Aidin on a stone slab, attempting the portal ritual. Greeve transformed into a Slaad and charged the shrine.

### Session 5 - The Vault Opens
After defeating the Fallen Priest, his body liquified and seeped into the earth, causing the ruins to shake and reveal an entrance to the vault beneath.
