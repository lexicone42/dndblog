# Xen'Drik

A vast, mysterious continent south of Khorvaire. Xen'Drik rises from the horizon as a wall of green jungle, broken ruins, black cliffs, and distant storms that never fully dissipate.

## Description

The land itself seems alive. Lightning flickers far inland. Massive stone shapes loom above the canopy—ruins too large to have been built by human hands. The remnants of the giant empires that fell millennia ago.

## The Ley Nexus

Xen'Drik contains a massive nexus of ley energy throughout its lands. The leylines here thrum so loudly they can be felt in one's bones. The jungle breathes in slow, rhythmic cycles, and deep below the surface, something pulses like a heartbeat.

The Emerald Enclave has received intelligence of ley disturbances here—the Slanted Circle may be attempting to activate their stolen regulator at this ancient source of power.

## Dangers

- **Untamed wilderness**: The jungle doesn't forget trespassers
- **Primitive clans**: Including the Drow who guard "forbidden ley ground"
- **Ancient magic**: Ruins that have stood since before humans walked these lands
- **Clan wars**: Constant conflict between territorial factions

## Session 11 Arrival

The party arrived in Xen'Drik aboard the Stormlight, landing at Stormreach after surviving an airship battle with Circle agents. They now pursue the Circle expedition into the jungle interior.

> *"That land doesn't forget trespassers. Prepare for landing at Stormreach."*
> — Captain Tallow
