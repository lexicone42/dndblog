# Dhakaani Empire

An ancient goblinoid civilization that once ruled beneath what is now Sharn. Though fallen millennia ago, their undead guardians still protect the Heart Stone.

## Philosophy

Their inscriptions reveal their creed:
- "Hold the line."
- "The war is eternal."
- "Guard the heart."

## Hierarchy

- **Hobgoblin Warriors and Generals** - The military backbone
- **War Scholars** - Became Wraith-Tacticians in death
- **Warlords** - Supreme commanders (General Varkuun was the last)

## Legacy

The Dhakaani sealed the ley anchor beneath Sharn and set eternal guardians to protect it. Their statues "bowed" and released light motes when the party restored balance—a final acknowledgment of duty transferred.

## Current State

- Ruins beneath Sharn remain
- Undead guardians still protect the depths
- Party has been named the new guardians by General Varkuun
