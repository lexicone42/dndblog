# The Knock

"Protectors of the wildlands, friends of the forest" — the Knock is a subfaction of the Emerald Enclave operating in the Astgrove region.

## Members

Rangers in forest green, operating in the north woods. They monitor threats to the natural order, particularly the Slanted Circle's corruption of the Astralglades.

## Compromised

Harlix Darkleaf was a prominent member of the Knock before his betrayal was revealed. His infiltration raises questions about how deeply the Slanted Circle has compromised this chapter.
