# Molrik Clan

A dwarven clan dwelling beneath Sharn, near the ancient Dhakaani ruins. They maintain the last outpost before the goblinoid depths.

## The Forward Camp

The Molrik clan's forward camp sits in ancient dwarven passages, lit by magma streams flowing through forges that have burned for centuries.

## Recognition

- **Glun**, a clan member, recognized Skid as "Stone-born"
- The clan sensed the ley flux the party carried
- Master Molrik personally led them to the Dhakaani entrance

## Alliance

After the party stabilized the Heart Stone anchor:
- Magical items from the clan's forge
- "Eternal respect" granted
- Took custody of the traitor Harlix
- Accepted Dragonshards for safekeeping
