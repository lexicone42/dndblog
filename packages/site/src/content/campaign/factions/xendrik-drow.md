# Xen'Drik Drow

The drow of Xen'Drik are not the same as their Underdark cousins in other realms. These ancient dark elves have dwelt in the jungle continent since before human civilizations rose, and they guard its secrets with lethal efficiency.

## First Contact

In Session 11, a patrol of six drow—five warriors and one who appeared to be a priestess or scout leader—intercepted the party in the jungle. They descended from the canopy on silken ropes, emerging from shadows with practiced ease.

Their leader spoke:

> *"You chase foolishly. The party you follow, and those before them, they have trespassed into forbidden ley ground. They are reckless. The land does not know them."*

She studied the party carefully before asking:

> *"What is your purpose here? You are unfamiliar with this land."*

## Stance

The drow are not allied with the Slanted Circle. They view the Circle's expedition as dangerous trespassers who threaten the sacred ley grounds they've protected for millennia.

Whether they will become allies or obstacles to the party remains to be seen. They appeared to be evaluating whether the party posed a threat—or represented a solution to the Circle problem.

## Known Capabilities

- Expert jungle navigation and stealth
- Silken rope descent from the canopy
- Night vision and shadow-stepping
- Deep knowledge of Xen'Drik's leyline network
- Warriors armed with weapons suited to jungle combat

## The Forbidden Ley Ground

The drow spoke of "forbidden ley ground" that the Circle has trespassed upon. This suggests the drow serve as guardians of specific leyline locations within Xen'Drik—places of power that outsiders are not permitted to approach.

## Status

The party stands at a crossroads. The drow await an answer that will determine whether they become guides or enemies.
