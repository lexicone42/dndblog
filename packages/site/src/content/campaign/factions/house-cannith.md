# House Cannith

The dragonmarked House of Making, House Cannith has dominated magical manufacturing across Khorvaire for centuries. Their Mark of Making allows them to create and repair with unparalleled skill.

## History

House Cannith rose to prominence during the Last War, when their creation forges produced warforged soldiers and magical weapons for all sides of the conflict. The Day of Mourning shattered their leadership, and the house has been divided into factions ever since.

## The Regulator Project

With the ley network beneath Sharn destabilizing, House Cannith artificers have been working on a device called "the regulator"—technology designed to stabilize the entire network at once.

Arvell d'Cannith leads this research from Skyway Hall, coordinating with the Emerald Enclave and others who understand the threat.

## The Theft

During a briefing with the party, Slanted Circle agents attacked Skyway Hall Suite 47, stealing the regulator schematics and all backup copies. This theft represents not just a setback but a potential catastrophe—the Circle now has the knowledge to weaponize House Cannith's research.

## Current Status

House Cannith works desperately to reconstruct the stolen plans while racing against time. The Ley Maw grows, and without the regulator, Sharn's magical infrastructure may collapse entirely.
