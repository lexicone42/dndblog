# The Black Mantle

A once-feared espionage syndicate that operated in Sharn's underworlds. Now apparently defunct or displaced.

## The Cover

The party traveled to Sharn under Black Mantle identities, provided by their Emerald Enclave contacts. The cover was meant to allow them to move freely through the city's darker corners.

## Cover Blown

At the Cornerstone Tavern, thugs revealed the truth: "The Mantle don't walk Sharn no more."

Elder Mossbark later confessed that the Black Mantle identities were intentionally given to make the party easier to track—drawing out the Slanted Circle's agents.
