# Emerald Enclave

A druidic organization with chapters across multiple planes, united in the mission to protect the natural order. Members wear a leaf pendant on their right breast as identification.

## Structure

### High Council
Governs major decisions across all planes. Rook Targrave is a member.

### The Knock
A subfaction based in the Astgrove region, known as "protectors of the wildlands, friends of the forest."

### Verdant Hollow
The Sharn chapter, led by Elder Elarion Mossbark, hidden in a hollowed tower garden.

## Resources

- **The Keyport**: Ancient planar junction beneath the Heartwood Oak
- **Ley Stones**: Powers travel through the Keyport
- **Network of Contacts**: Spanning multiple planes

## Current Mission

- Stop the Slanted Circle from awakening Aru'xat
- Anchor the ley lines to prevent world destruction
- Track down ley anchors across planes
- Root out traitors within their ranks

## Internal Struggle

The revelation of Harlix Darkleaf as a Slanted Circle agent has shaken the Enclave. Trust is fractured, and suspicion runs deep.
