# The Party

The adventuring party at the heart of this chronicle. Originally from Phandalin, they followed the legend of the Bell of Shavras and became entangled in a cosmic struggle for the world's survival.

## Current Status

**Location:** Deep in the jungles of Xen'Drik, approximately one hour behind the [Slanted Circle](/campaign/factions/slanted-circle) expedition.

**Situation:** Having tracked the Circle from Stormreach into the jungle interior, the party has just encountered a patrol of [Xen'Drik Drow](/campaign/factions/xendrik-drow). The drow are not allied with the Circle and appear to view them as dangerous trespassers on sacred ley ground. Whether they will become allies or obstacles remains to be determined.

**Recent Events:**
- Said farewell to [Kei](/campaign/characters/kei), who returned home to found the Eaglesnout Academy
- Departed Sharn aboard the [Stormlight](/campaign/items/the-stormlight) with [Captain Tallow](/campaign/characters/captain-tallow)
- Survived an ambush by a Circle airship in the clouds
- Captured the enemy vessel after a fierce sky battle
- Made landfall at Stormreach and picked up the Circle's trail
- Defeated the Circle's rear guard in the jungle
- Now face a decision as the drow await their answer

## Active Members

- **[Accoa Krigsdottir](/campaign/characters/accoa)** - Paladin, Oath of the Ancients
- **[Malum Munus Exemplar](/campaign/characters/malum)** - Assassin, shadow operative
- **[Rudiger](/campaign/characters/rudiger)** - Wizard, evoker and arcane specialist
- **[Skid Demon](/campaign/characters/skid-demon)** - Ranger, ley-touched Stone-born
- **[Stol](/campaign/characters/stol)** - Cleric, Life Domain healer

Each member now wears a piece of Eaglesnout Tartan, a parting gift from Kei that grants +1 Strength.

## Former Members

- **[Kei Eaglesnout](/campaign/characters/kei)** - Fighter, retired in Session 11 to found the [Eaglesnout Academy](/eaglesnout-academy). The Emerald Enclave provided a grant to rebuild his family farm and establish a training school for future guardians.
- **Greeve** - Now eternal guardian of the Shavras vault
- **Dain** - Betrayer, fate unknown

## Mission

Stabilize the ley anchors across multiple planes to prevent the awakening of Aru'xat the Verdant Maw.

**Immediate Objective:** Stop the Slanted Circle from activating their stolen ley regulator at a massive leyline nexus somewhere in Xen'Drik. The Circle believes the Ley Maw is not a threat but a door. [Rook](/campaign/characters/rook-targrave) has warned that they do not understand the power they are attempting to control.

## Key Allies

- **[Emerald Enclave](/campaign/factions/emerald-enclave)** - Primary patron and source of intelligence
- **[Rook Targrave](/campaign/characters/rook-targrave)** - Enclave handler who coordinates their missions
- **[Captain Tallow](/campaign/characters/captain-tallow)** - Airship captain, pilot of the Stormlight

## Assets

- **The Stormlight** - Storm-grey airship, currently docked at Stormreach
- **Captured Circle Vessel** - Prize from the sky battle
- **Eaglesnout Tartan** - Kei's parting gift (+1 STR each)
- **[Circle Cipher Disk](/campaign/items/circle-cipher-disk)** - Recovered from the Circle rear guard
- **Partially Burned Map** - Shows path to an ancient ruin with an unfamiliar symbol
