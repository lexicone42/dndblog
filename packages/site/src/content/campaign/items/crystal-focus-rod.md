# Crystal Focus Rod

A foot-long rod of pale blue crystal, cool to the touch and humming faintly with arcane resonance. The crystal seems to have been grown rather than carved, with natural facets that catch and refract light.

## Properties

**Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)**

While holding this rod, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls made with spells that deal force damage.

The rod can also be used as an arcane focus for spellcasting.

## History

This focus was recovered from a Slanted Circle Cultist Mage in the Xen'Drik jungle ambush during Session 11. The Circle appears to favor force magic in their combat doctrine, making these focus rods valuable tools for their spellcasters.

## Value

Worth approximately 200 gp to arcane practitioners, particularly those who specialize in evocation or force-based magic.
