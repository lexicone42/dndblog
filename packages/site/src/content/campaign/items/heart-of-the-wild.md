# The Heart of the Wild

A legendary Dragonshard bound with natural magic, The Heart of the Wild pulses with the same green light that swept through Sharn's lanterns when the Emerald Enclave signaled its gratitude.

## Appearance

Contained in a small chest of living wood with golden veins crawling across its surface, the Heart itself glows with an inner emerald light. It feels warm to the touch and seems to pulse in time with the bearer's heartbeat.

## Origin

The Emerald Enclave has held this artifact for generations, waiting for those who would prove themselves worthy by stabilizing the ley anchors without destroying them—or themselves.

## Bestowment

After the party stabilized the Heart Stone beneath Sharn, Lux delivered the Heart of the Wild at The Floating Trinket in the Sky Market:

*"The Enclave sends its blessings. Though I suspect you'll need them sooner than you'd like."*

## Properties

The Heart of the Wild resonates with ley energy. Its full capabilities are not yet known, but those who carry it feel more connected to the natural flow of magic in the world.

## Current Status

In the party's possession. The Heart's power may prove crucial in the coming conflict with the Slanted Circle.
