# Ley Stone

An ancient artifact obtained from Nythraxil's lair on Stonehell Isle. The stone was literally fused to the dragon's quartz body, extracted only when the dragon chose to give it.

## Purpose

The ley stone anchors ley lines in the Astralglades, preventing the Slanted Circle from completing their corruption of that region. However, it only works for one area—other anchors are needed elsewhere.

## Current Status

Given to Rook Targrave and the Emerald Enclave for safekeeping and proper deployment.
