# The Stormlight

Captain Tallow's airship, a marvel of Khorvairian engineering and elemental binding. The Stormlight carried the party from Sharn to Xen'Drik.

## Description

The airship's deck is suspended beneath a great oblong balloon, with harnesses and ropes crisscrossing the rigging. Giant wind turbines spin at each side, and cannons rest at the rails. A crossbow the size of a person dominates the bow.

At the stern, a massive rudder juts into open air. At the front, an air elemental is bound to the ship by arcane chains of silver and sapphire, its form swirling endlessly within a crystalline containment sphere.

## Armaments

- Cannons on each side of the deck
- Crossbow mounted at the bow
- Emergency repair capabilities

## The Air Elemental

The Stormlight is powered by a bound air elemental—the wind itself. According to Tallow, the binding follows a standard Lyrandar contract: a century of service, then freedom with accumulated interest. "As humane as such things can be."

## Session 11: The Sky Battle

En route to Xen'Drik, the Stormlight was ambushed by a Slanted Circle airship. After a fierce aerial battle amid storm clouds and crosswinds, the party defeated the Circle agents and captured the enemy vessel intact.
