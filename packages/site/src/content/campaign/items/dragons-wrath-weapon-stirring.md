# Dragon's Wrath Longsword (Stirring)

This longsword is decorated with dragon motifs and glows with inner fire when drawn. It was forged with the essence of dragon's wrath, granting its wielder a taste of draconic fury.

## Properties

**Dragon's Wrath.** When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the type associated with your dragon (fire, in this case).

**Stirring Strike.** As a bonus action, you can surround the weapon in a wreath of flames. The next time you hit a creature with this weapon before the end of your turn, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

## Significance

Accoa wields this blade as a symbol of righteous fury, channeling draconic fire against the enemies of the realm. The weapon's sap mastery allows her to debilitate foes even further in combat.
