# Eaglesnout Tartan

A piece of tartan cloth bearing the distinctive pattern of the Eaglesnout clan: deep forest green crossed with threads of gold and crimson—the colors of earth, of harvest, of blood shed in defense of home.

## Properties

**Strength of the Champion**: When equipped, the tartan raises the wearer's Strength score by +1.

## Origin

Kei Eaglesnout left these tartans for each party member when he departed in Session 11 to rebuild his family farm and found the Eaglesnout Academy. The gift was accompanied by a letter:

> *"My friends, it has been one of life's great joys to come to know and fight alongside you all. I hold hope that our paths will cross again. Until then, wield your strength in my absence."*

## Significance

The tartan is more than cloth—it carries a piece of Kei himself. The strength he built through years of labor, competition, and battle now aids his former companions. Each party member wears their tartan differently: tied to arms, packs, or weapons.

A reminder that Kei didn't leave them alone. He left them stronger.
