# Mace of Disruption

A holy weapon particularly effective against undead, recovered from the Shavras shrine. The mace radiates divine energy that disrupts the negative energy animating undead creatures.

## Significance

Given the party's frequent encounters with undead forces—from the Fallen Priest's minions to the Dhakaani Wraith-Tacticians—this weapon has proven invaluable.
