# Devotee's Censer

This metal censer can be wielded as a flail that deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit. The censer swings on a chain and burns with holy incense, leaving trails of sacred smoke as it arcs through battle.

## Properties

**Radiant Strike.** While you are holding this holy weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage when you hit with it.

**Holy Symbol.** The censer can be used as a holy symbol for spellcasting. While holding it, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls.

**Sacred Incense.** As a bonus action, you can cause the censer to emit a cloud of sacred smoke. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d6 radiant damage. You can use this property a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Significance

Stol carries this censer as both a weapon and a focus for divine magic, embodying the militant aspect of clerical devotion. The sacred smoke it produces serves as both blessing and weapon against the forces of darkness.
