# Dryad's Bow

A magical bow crafted by Dryad Erinthin, gifted to Skid Demon as a mark of trust and alliance.

## Recognition

When Harlix Darkleaf first met the party, he immediately recognized the Dryad's bow. It served as proof that the party was allied with the forest guardians and, by extension, the Emerald Enclave.

## Current Owner

Skid Demon carries the bow as both weapon and symbol of the party's connection to the natural forces that oppose the Slanted Circle.
