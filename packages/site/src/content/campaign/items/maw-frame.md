# The Maw Frame

Also called the "Throat of Aru'xat," the Maw Frame is a massive wooden construction shaped like a giant jaw. It is being built in the corrupted north woods of the Astralglades.

## Purpose

The Maw Frame is a resonance engine designed to:
1. Align the world's ley lines
2. Generate vibrations matching Aru'xat's frequency
3. Shatter the seals binding the primordial
4. Awaken the Verdant Maw

## Construction

The Slanted Circle is using enslaved humans to cut down ancient trees and construct the Frame. Purple-robed cultists oversee the work.

## Current Status

Under construction. The party has witnessed it but not yet moved to destroy it.
