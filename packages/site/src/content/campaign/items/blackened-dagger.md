# Blackened Dagger

A slender ritual dagger with a blade that seems to drink in light. The metal has been stained permanently black by repeated exposure to infernal oil—a substance used in the Slanted Circle's darker rituals.

## Properties

**Weapon (dagger), uncommon (requires attunement)**

- +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
- The blade is warm to the touch, even in cold conditions
- When drawn in darkness, the blade seems to absorb ambient light within 5 feet

## History

This dagger was recovered from a Slanted Circle Cultist Mage during the jungle ambush in Session 11. The infernal oil staining suggests it was used in blood rituals or summoning rites before being pressed into service as a combat weapon.

## Value

Worth approximately 200 gp to collectors of occult curiosities, though some temples might pay more to see it destroyed.
