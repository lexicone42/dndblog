# Arcane Razor

A slender longsword with an unusually thin blade, etched along its length with slanted runes that pulse faintly with contained arcane energy. The weapon was clearly crafted for the Blademancers of the Slanted Circle.

## Properties

**Weapon (longsword), uncommon**

The Arcane Razor is a magic weapon. Its latent magical properties are currently dormant, but a skilled enchanter could potentially unlock them.

In its current state:
- Functions as a masterwork longsword
- The runes glow faintly when within 60 feet of active leyline energy
- Counts as magical for overcoming resistance

## Potential

A skilled enchanter examining this blade could potentially unlock its dormant properties, enhancing it to a +1 weapon or imbuing it with force damage similar to how the Blademancers wielded it in combat.

## History

Recovered from a Cultist Blademancer during the Xen'Drik jungle ambush in Session 11. The Blademancers use these weapons in their distinctive "Blade Dance" fighting style, teleporting short distances while striking.

## Value

Worth approximately 150 gp to a collector, or potentially more to an enchanter interested in studying Circle runic magic.
