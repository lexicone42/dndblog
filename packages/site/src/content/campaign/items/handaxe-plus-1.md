# Handaxe +1

A perfectly balanced handaxe with a keen edge that never seems to dull. The weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

## Properties

**Magic Weapon.** You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

**Light & Thrown.** This weapon can be thrown (range 20/60) and is light enough for dual-wielding. Kei uses the vex mastery to gain advantage against distracted foes.

## Significance
