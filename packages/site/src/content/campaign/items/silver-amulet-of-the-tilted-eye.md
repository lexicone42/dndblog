# Silver Amulet of the Tilted Eye

A palm-sized silver medallion on a fine chain, engraved with the distinctive slanted eye symbol of the Circle. The eye seems to shift slightly when viewed from different angles—an unsettling optical effect that hints at its magical nature.

## Properties

**Wondrous item, uncommon**

While wearing this amulet, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to planar magic, including:
- Identifying portals and dimensional rifts
- Understanding leyline confluences
- Recognizing extraplanar entities
- Deciphering Circle ritual inscriptions

## History

This amulet was worn by a Slanted Circle Cultist Mage encountered during the Xen'Drik jungle ambush in Session 11. Such amulets appear to be standard issue for Circle spellcasters, aiding their research into dimensional magic and leyline manipulation.

## Value

Worth approximately 150 gp, though its association with the Circle might make it difficult to sell openly.
