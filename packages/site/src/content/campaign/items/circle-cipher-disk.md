# Circle Cipher Disk

A palm-sized brass disk with two rotating plates covered in arcane symbols. When aligned correctly, the disk can encode or decode messages written in the Slanted Circle's cipher system.

## Properties

**Tool, common**

The cipher disk allows the user to:
- Decode messages written in the Circle's standard field cipher
- Encode messages in the same cipher
- With study (DC 15 Intelligence check), potentially decode variations used by different Circle cells

The disk does not provide magical translation—it simply shifts symbols according to a mechanical pattern.

## Intelligence Value

This disk could prove invaluable for intercepting Circle communications. Combined with the Cult Parchment also recovered in Session 11, it may reveal the Circle's plans in Xen'Drik.

## History

Recovered from a Slanted Circle operative during the Xen'Drik jungle ambush in Session 11. The fact that field agents carry these suggests the Circle maintains encrypted communication networks even in remote operations.

## Value

Minimal monetary value (perhaps 25 gp as a curiosity), but potentially priceless as an intelligence asset against the Circle.
