# Heart Stone

A black obsidian monolith veined with pulsing light, the Heart Stone serves as the ley anchor for all of Eberron.

## Location

Deep in the Heart Stone Chamber beneath Sharn, surrounded by twelve statues of Dhakaani generals and ley conduits that feed into the walls.

## The Voice

When the party approached, a voice spoke from the skulls: "The Heart endures. Who commands the stone?"

General Varkuun rose to test them, and upon his defeat, passed guardianship to the party.

## Skid's Connection

Skid Demon's heartbeat synchronized with the Heart Stone's pulses. The ley mark he carries connects him to this anchor—he has become a living compass to ley energy.

## Current Status

STABILIZED by the party. The anchor holds, but the Circle Mage's appearance suggests the enemy knew of it and may have other plans.
