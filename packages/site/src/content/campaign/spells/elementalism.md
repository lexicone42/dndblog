# Elementalism

*Transmutation cantrip*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S, M (fur or a feather)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You exert control over the elements, creating one of the following effects within range. Beckon Air. You create a breeze strong enough to ripple cloth, stir dust, rustle leaves, and close open doors and shutters, all in a 5-foot Cube. Doors and shutters being held open by someone or something aren’t affected. Beckon Earth. You create a thin shroud of dust or sand that covers surfaces in a 5-foot-square area, or you cause a single word to appear in your handwriting in a patch of dirt or sand. Beckon Fire. You create a thin cloud of harmless embers and colored, scented smoke in a 5-foot Cube. You choose the color and scent, and the embers can light candles, torches, or lamps in that area. The smoke’s scent lingers for 1 minute. Beckon Water. You create a spray of cool mist that lightly dampens creatures and objects in a 5-foot Cube. Alternatively, you create 1 cup of clean water either in an open container or on a surface, and the water evaporates in 1 minute. Sculpt Element. You cause dirt, sand, fire, smoke, mist, or water that can fit in a 1-foot Cube to assume a crude shape (such as that of a creature) for 1 hour. Enhance Ability Level 2 Transmutation (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard) You touch a creature and choose Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. For the duration, the target has Advantage on ability checks using the chosen ability.

**At Higher Levels.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 2. You can choose a different ability for each target.
