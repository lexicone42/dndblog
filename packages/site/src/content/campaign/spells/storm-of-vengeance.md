# Storm of Vengeance

*Level 9 conjuration*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, M (a drop of honey)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

A churning storm cloud forms for the duration, centered on a point within range and spreading to a radius of 300 feet. Each creature under the cloud when it appears must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 Thunder damage and have the Deafened condition for the duration. At the start of each of your later turns, the storm produces different effects, as detailed below. Turn 2. Acidic rain falls. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 4d6 Acid damage. Turn 3. You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six different creatures or objects beneath it. Each target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  Turn 4. Hailstones rain down. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage. Turns 5–10. Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. Each creature there takes 1d6 Cold damage. Until the spell ends, the area is Difficult Terrain and Heavily Obscured, ranged attacks with weapons are impossible there, and strong wind blows through the area. Suggestion Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard) You suggest a course of activity—described in no more than 25 words—to one creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. The suggestion must sound achievable and not involve anything that would obviously deal damage to the target or its allies. For example, you could say, “Fetch the key to the cult’s treasure vault, and give the key to me.” Or you could say, “Stop fighting, leave this library peacefully, and don’t return.” The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage to the target. The Charmed target pursues the suggestion to the best of its ability. The suggested activity can continue for the entire duration, but if the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends for the target upon completing it.
