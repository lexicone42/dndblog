# Power Word Heal

*Level 9 enchantment*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over one creature you can see within range. The target regains all its Hit Points. If the creature has the Charmed, Frightened, Paralyzed, Poisoned, or Stunned condition, the condition ends. If the creature has the Prone condition, it can use its Reaction to stand up. Power Word Kill Level 9 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard) You compel one creature you can see within range to die. If the target has 100 Hit Points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, it takes 12d12 Psychic damage. Power Word Stun Level 8 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard) You overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 Hit Points or fewer, it has the Stunned condition. Otherwise, its Speed is 0 until the start of your next turn. The Stunned target makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.
