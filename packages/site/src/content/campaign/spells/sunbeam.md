# Sunbeam

*Level 6 evocation*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You launch a sunbeam in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long Line. Each creature in the Line makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 Radiant damage and has the Blinded condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only. Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to create a new Line of radiance. For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines above you. It sheds Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.
