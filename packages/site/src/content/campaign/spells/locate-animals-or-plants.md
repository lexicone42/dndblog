# Locate Animals or Plants

*Level 2 divination*

**Casting Time:** Action (ritual)
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M (a forked twig)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Describe or name a specific kind of Beast, Plant creature, or nonmagical plant. You learn the direction and distance to the closest creature or plant of that kind within 5 miles, if any are present.  Locate Creature Level 4 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Wizard) Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature’s location if that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement. The spell can locate a specific creature known to you or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn) if you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as under the effects of a Flesh to Stone or Polymorph spell, this spell doesn’t locate the creature. This spell can’t locate a creature if any thickness of lead blocks a direct path between you and the creature. Locate Object Level 2 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Wizard) Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object’s location if that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement. The spell can locate a specific object known to you if you have seen it up close—within 30 feet—at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon. This spell can’t locate an object if any thickness of lead blocks a direct path between you and the object.
