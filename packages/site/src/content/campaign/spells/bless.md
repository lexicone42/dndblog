# Bless

*Level 1 enchantment*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You bless up to three creatures within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target adds 1d4 to the attack roll or save. A creature that you can see within range makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Plant creature automatically fails the save. Alternatively, target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub. It doesn’t make a save; it simply withers and dies.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage in- creases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4.
