A 10-foot Emanation springs into existence around you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell fails when you cast it if the Emanation isn’t big enough to fully encapsulate all creatures in its area. Creatures and objects within the Emanation when you cast the spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells of level 3 or lower can’t be cast through it, and the effects of such spells can’t extend into it.

Tongues Level 3 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard) This spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken or signed language that it hears or sees. Moreover, when the target communicates by speaking or signing, any creature that  knows at least one language can understand it if that creature can hear the speech or see the signing.
