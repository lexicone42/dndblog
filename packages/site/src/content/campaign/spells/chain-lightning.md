# Chain Lightning

*Level 6 evocation*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** 1 hour

You launch a lightning bolt toward a target you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets of your choice, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts. Each target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with Advantage if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it. The Charmed creature is Friendly to you. When the spell ends, the target knows it was Charmed by you. One Humanoid you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with Advantage if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it. The Charmed creature is Friendly to you. When the spell ends, the target knows it was Charmed by you.

**At Higher Levels.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
