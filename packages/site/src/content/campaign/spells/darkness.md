# Darkness

*Level 2 evocation*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, magical Darkness spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. Darkvision can’t see through it, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn’t being worn or carried, causing the Darkness to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the Darkness. If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of Bright Light or Dim Light created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled. Darkvision Level 2 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard) For the duration, a willing creature you touch has Darkvision with a range of 150 feet. Daylight Level 3 Evocation (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer) For the duration, sunlight spreads from a point within range and fills a 60-foot-radius Sphere. The sunlight’s area is Bright Light and sheds Dim Light for an additional 60 feet. Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn’t being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to fill a 60-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight. If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of Darkness created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.
