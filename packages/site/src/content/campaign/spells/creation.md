# Creation

*Level 5 illusion*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create an object within range. It is either an object of vegetable matter (soft goods, rope, wood, and the like) or mineral matter (stone, crystal, metal, and the like). The object must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen. The spell’s duration depends on the object’s material, as shown in the Materials table. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration. Using any object created by this spell as another spell’s Material component causes the other spell to fail. Materials Material Duration Vegetable matter 24 hours Stone or crystal 12 hours Precious metals 1 hour Gems 10 minutes Adamantine or mithral 1 minute A creature you touch regains a number of Hit Points equal to 2d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**At Higher Levels.** The healing in- creases by 2d8 for each spell slot level above 1.
