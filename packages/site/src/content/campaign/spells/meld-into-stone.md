# Meld into Stone

*Level 3 transmutation*

**Casting Time:** Action (ritual)
**Range:** 120 feet
**Components:** S, M (a copper wire)
**Duration:** 1 round

You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, merging yourself and your equipment with the stone for the duration. You must touch the stone to do so. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses. While merged with the stone, you can’t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with Disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use 5 feet of movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can’t move. Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 Force damage to you. The stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 Force damage to you. If expelled, you move into an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered and have the Prone condition. Mending Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard) This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. This spell can physically repair a magic item, but it can’t restore magic to such an object. Message Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard) You point toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear. You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence; 1 foot of stone, metal, or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.
