# Phantom Steed

*Level 3 illusion*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute (ritual)
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** 1 hour

A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s appearance, and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed. For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The steed uses the Riding Horse stat block (see “Monsters”), except it has a Speed of 100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if the steed takes any damage.
