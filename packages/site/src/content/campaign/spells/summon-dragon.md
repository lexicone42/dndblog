# Summon Dragon

*Level 5 conjuration*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (an object with the image of a dragon engraved on it worth 500+ GP)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a Dragon spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the Draconic Spirit stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**At Higher Levels.** Use the spell slot’s level for the spell’s level in the stat block.
