# Moonbeam

*Level 2 evocation*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 120 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a moonseed leaf)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, Dim Light fills the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action on later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet. When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the Polymorph spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can’t shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell’s area moves into its space and when it enters the spell’s area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage in- creases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 2.
